\title{Add Abstract Element}
\usage{
add_abstract(parent_element, abstract)
}
\arguments{
\item{abstract}{Abstract paragraphs, requires a minimum of 20 words.}

\item{parament_element}{A list representing the EML project or dataset.}
}
\value{
The dataset or project with abstract appended
}
\description{
Adds the abstract of a dataset according to EML standards.
}
\details{
For	a	dataset,	the	abstract	element	can	appear	at	the	resource	level	or	the	project level.
The	<abstract>	element	will	be	used	for	full-text	searches,	and	it	should	be	rich	with
descriptive	text.	In	particular,	descriptions	should	include	information	that	does	not	fit	into
structured	metadata,	and	focus	on	the	“what”,	“when”,	and	“where”	information,	general
taxonomic	information,	as	well	as	whether	the	dataset	is	ongoing	or	completed.	Some
general	methods	description	is	appropriate,	and	broad	classes	of	measured	parameters
should	also	be	included.		For	a	large	number	of	parameters,	use	categories	instead	of	listing
all	parameters	(e.g.	use	the	term	“nutrients”	instead	of	nitrate,	phosphate,	calcium,	etc.),	in
combination	with	the	parameters	that	seem	most	relevant	for	searches.
