\examples{
add_method(data_collection_method_title = "Climate Data",
           method_description = "Daily temperature (maximum/minimum) and
           precipitation data were obtained for each stand from 1996 to 2011

           Oregon State University, http://prism.oregonstate.edu, created 26 Mar 2015)
           by interpolating 4km2 resolution climate data at the centroid of each
           eastern hemlock stand using values from surrounding grid cell centers
           and inverse-distance squared weighting.", instrumentation = "Thermometer")
                
If the method has a longer description than one paragraph:
description1 <- "This is the first paragraph" 
description2 <- "This is the second paragraph." 
description = list(description1 description2)
add_method(data_collection_method_title = "The Data", method_description = description,
                instrumentation = "The applicable instrument")
