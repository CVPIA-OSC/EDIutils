One mechanism explaining the success of invasive weeds may be the production and release of allelopathic compounds by the invader that, due to a lack of co-evolutionary history, have harmful effects on plant neighbours in the introduced range. 2. We partially tested this hypothesis by growing seven competing native European plant species either with the introduced Solidago canadensis s.l., one of the most successful invasive plants in Europe or on soil pre-cultivated with S. canadensis. We added activated carbon to the soil to neutralize organic chemical compounds with putative allelopathic effects. Furthermore, we added unsterilized soil inocula from the introduced (Switzerland) or native (USA) range to the soil to test potential confounding effects of soil microbes on invasion success. Untreated sterilized soil served as control. 3. Five out of the seven native species were more competitive against the invasive species in soils with activated carbon than without, supporting the allelopathy hypothesis. However, competitive outcomes were also influenced by the two sources of soil inoculum and by interactive effects of soil inoculum and Solidago origin suggesting that soil microbes alter allelopathic effects. 4. Achillea millefolium, the species least affected by the presence of S. canadensis and with no response to the activated carbon treatment is the only species used in this experiment reported to grow within Solidago stands in Europe, whereas the other European species tested tend to grow at the periphery of invasive Solidago stands. 5. Chemical analysis by LC-MS of Solidago root extracts revealed four main secondary chemical compounds with potential allelopathic effects. Root exudates of Solidago showed a significant inhibitory effect on growth of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. The magnitude of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of the extract. Synthesis. Levels of the four compounds were lower in Solidago populations from the invasive range than in populations of the same ploidy level from the native range. This suggests lower investment of invasive plants into these secondary compounds, possibly because of a higher susceptibility of plant competitors in the invasive range to these substances.",Web of Science,Solidago canadensis,Switzerland,Zürich,University of Zürich,47.55,8.6167,Greenhouse;Garden,terrestrial,,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Novel Weapons,,primary

It has been introduced to North America where it has often established dense stands in both secondary woodlands and relatively undisturbed mature woodlands. In Europe A. platanoides is also extending its original range, but generally seems to exist at much lower densities. One explanation for the 'aggressiveness' of invasive plants such as A. platanoides is that they have left behind pests and diseases which limit their population densities in their native lands (the enemy release hypothesis or ERH). To assess the ERH for Norway maple, a large network of collaborators assessed leaf herbivory rates in populations throughout Europe and North America. We found significantly lower total leaf herbivory (1.6% +/- A 0.19, n = 21 vs. 7.4% +/- A 1.94, n = 34) and lower fungal damage (1.0% +/- A 0.35, n = 13 vs. 3.7% +/- A 0.85, n = 34) in North America than in Europe over a 2 year period, which is consistent with the predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis. Across years, the average total leaf herbivory was significantly correlated with average annual temperature of the site (P < 0.05), although this was mostly due to sites in Europe (P < 0.001), and not sites in North America (P > 0.05). Furthermore, only populations in Europe showed very high levels of herbivory (e.g., nine sites had total leaf herbivory ranging from 10.0 to 51.2% in at least 1 year) or leaf fungal damage (only one site in North America showed high levels of fungal damage in 1 year), suggesting the possibility of more frequent episodic outbreaks in the native range. Leaf herbivory and fungal damage are only two aspects of consumer pressure and we do not know whether the differences reported here are enough to actually elicit release from top-down population control, but such large scale biogeographic differences in herbivory contribute towards understanding exotic invasions.",Web of Science,Acer platanoides,,,"Europe, North America",,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

M.",2009,Diversity declines in Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass) patches,journal,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,142,5,1003,1010,"The spread of invasive plant species and their impacts on plant communities have received international attention as global trade and global environmental change enhance the colonization and establishment of introduced species and threaten the integrity of native ecosystems. Because introduced species vary in their impact, studying the relationship between invasion and native communities is necessary to guide allocation of finite management resources. By studying adjacent pairs of invaded and uninvaded plots across an eastern United States forested landscape, we demonstrate Microstegium vimineum was associated with local declines in species richness and cover of native species. Negative impacts of M. vimineum on species richness did not emerge until August when M. vimineum cover and height were greatest, highlighting the value of following study subjects through the growing season. In contrast, native species cover was already lower in invaded plots early in the growing season. M. vimineum invasion was not the only important driver of species richness and community composition within the study region: abiotic environmental gradients, such as soil nitrate concentration and pH, across the six study sites were also important in affecting species richness and cover, but lessened in explanatory power through the growing season. We conclude that M. vimineum has effects on community structure that may have long-term consequences for biodiversity. Studies which track sites through time and consider multiple scales are required as invaders impact multiple biotic and abiotic factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales.

We examined the effect of introduction into novel environments on genetic diversity of an insect pest, Adelges cooleyi, which was introduced into the eastern United States during the mid nineteenth century. We compared variation in mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in native and introduced samples to determine the effect of introduction on genetic variation experienced by this insect. We also measured an ecologically important phenotype, variation in host preference, in both native and introduced samples to compare variation in that trait with molecular genetic variation. To further investigate the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation, we examined the degree to which mtDNA haplotypes provide information about host preference. Adelges cooleyi in eastern North America has significantly reduced genetic and phenotypic variation, but this low variation does not appear to have prevented persistence in a novel environment.

In particular, the spread of alien plant species along such gradients might be limited by their ability to establish clinal patterns of trait variation. We investigated trends in growth and reproductive traits in natural populations of eight invasive Asteraceae forbs along altitudinal gradients in their native and introduced ranges (Valais, Switzerland, and Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA). Plants showed similar responses to altitude in both ranges, being generally smaller and having fewer inflorescences but larger seeds at higher altitudes. However, these trends were modified by region-specific effects that were independent of species status ( native or introduced), suggesting that any differential performance of alien species in the introduced range cannot be interpreted without a fully reciprocal approach to test the basis of these differences. Furthermore, we found differences in patterns of resource allocation to capitula among species in the native and the introduced areas. These suggest that the mechanisms underlying trait variation, for example, increasing seed size with altitude, might differ between ranges. The rapid establishment of clinal patterns of trait variation in the new range indicates that the need to respond to altitudinal gradients, possibly by local adaptation, has not limited the ability of these species to invade mountain regions.

Along altitudinal gradients, factors such as propagule pressure, climatic conditions and biotic interactions change simultaneously across rather small geographic scales. Here we investigate the distribution of eight Asteraceae forbs along mountain roads in both their native and introduced ranges in the Valais (southern Swiss Alps) and the Wallowa Mountains (northeastern Oregon, USA). We hypothesised that a lack of adaptation and more limiting propagule pressure at higher altitudes in the new range restricts the altitudinal distribution of aliens relative to the native range. However, all but one of the species reached the same or even a higher altitude in the new range. Thus neither the need to adapt to changing climatic conditions nor lower propagule pressure at higher altitudes appears to have prevented the altitudinal spread of introduced populations. We found clear differences between regions in the relative occurrence of alien species in ruderal sites compared to roadsides, and in the degree of invasion away from the roadside, presumably reflecting differences in disturbance patterns between regions. Whilst the upper altitudinal limits of these plant invasions are apparently climatically constrained, factors such as anthropogenic disturbance and competition with native vegetation appear to have greater influence than changing climatic conditions on the distribution of these alien species along altitudinal gradients.",Web of Science,Cirsium arvense;Cirsium vulgare;Cichorium intybus;Lactuca serriola;Conyza canadensis;Erigeron annuus;Matricaria discoidea;Solidago canadensis;Solidago lepida,Switzerland;United States,Valais;Oregon,Southern Alps;Wallowa Mountains,46.1667,7.3333,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Mountain,Fundamentals;Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Allegheny Mountains, West Virginia and Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA; Valais, southern Switzerland. Leaf material was collected from populations along altitudinal gradients and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci for each species. Differences in variability between native and introduced areas and in relation to altitude were analysed using linear models. Differences in the genetic, geographical and altitudinal structure of populations between areas were analysed by AMOVA, cluster analysis and Mantel tests. Genetic variation within and across populations of S. canadensis was significantly reduced, while populations of L. serriola were significantly more variable, in the introduced area. Genetic diversity decreased significantly with altitude for S. canadensis but not L. serriola. Genetic structure of S. canadensis was similar in both areas, and populations were isolated by geographical but not altitudinal distance. By contrast, population structure of L. serriola was much weaker in the introduced area, and populations were not isolated by distance in either area. Solidago canadensis has experienced a strong genetic bottleneck on introduction to the Valais, but this has not prevented it from colonizing a wide altitudinal range. Variation in neutral markers is therefore not necessarily a good measure for judging the ecological behaviour of a species. By contrast, the greater variability of L. serriola in the introduced area, where it also occurs over a greater altitudinal range, can be explained by increased outcrossing among admixed populations. This suggests that the ecological amplitude of alien species might be enhanced after population admixture in the new range, especially for species with highly structured native populations.

We studied richness, composition, and distribution of alien plants and compared them with native species along roads on Tenerife (Canary Islands). We studied a single road transect that sampled two contrasting wind-facing aspects (leeward versus windward) and ran from coastal Euphorbia scrubland through thermophilous scrubland to Makaronesian laurel forest at the top of a mountainous massif. We evaluated the effects of elevation, aspect, distance to urban nuclei, and several road-edge features (including road-edge width and management-implying disturbance intensity), using regression models, analysis of variance, and multivariate ordination methods. Richness of both endemics and native nonendemics was explained by elevation (related to well-defined vegetation belts), steepness of the edge slope, and cover of rocky ground. Despite a short elevational gradient (0-650 m), we found clear altitudinal zonation by biogeographic origin of both nonendemic natives and aliens, and altitudinal distribution of aliens followed the same zonation as that of natives. Alien species' richness was related to management intensity determining edge disturbance, road-edge width, and distance to the nearest urban nuclei (propagule sources). Different variables explained distribution patterns of natives, endemics, and aliens along roadsides on leeward and windward aspects. Altitude and aspect also had a strong influence on the frequency of life strategies (woody species, annuals and biennial/perennial herbs) of roadside plant communities. Due to harsher environmental filters operating on the leeward aspect, alien species were distributed along the altitudinal gradient in apparent consistency with general biogeographical affinities. Tropical/subtropical taxa showed exponential decrease with increasing elevation, Mediterranean taxa showed a unimodal response (i.e., maximum richness at mid elevation, minimum at the extremes of the gradient), and temperate taxa showed linear increase with elevation. Native but nonendemic species followed analogous trends to those of aliens. This suggests climatic matching as a prerequisite for successful invasion of this topographically complex island. Other road traits, such as edge width, slope steepness, soil cover, and road-edge disturbance intensity may play a complementary role, at a more local scale, to shape the distribution of alien plants on these island roads.",Web of Science,Many,Canary Islands,Tenerife,Anaga massif,28.543965,-16.202259,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Fundamentals;Invasion Hyp.,Preadaptation to Climate,,primary

Rainfall during the previous season was found to increase R. multiflora colonization during population expansion while tree species inhibited the invader's growth. During expansion and decline of R. multiflora, common associated species were often positively or negatively correlated with changes in R. multiflora cover.

Although both forms of competition are commonly studied, attempts to explore the interactions between direct and indirect competition are rare. We monitored the effects of several doses of extracts of Alliaria petiolata, a Eurasian invader in North America, on the growth of Impatiens pallida, a North American native, at several planting densities. The density-dependent phytotoxicity model predicts that as plant density increases, individual plant size will decrease, unless a toxin is present in the soil. In this case, individual plant size is predicted to increase as plant density increases, as plants share a limited toxin dose. We tested this model using fractions of an A. petiolata extract enriched in flavonoids or glucosinolates, as well as a combined fraction. The flavonoid-enriched fraction and the combined fraction suppressed I. pallida growth but only when applied at a dose eight times higher than that expected in the field. When treated with a dose equivalent to estimated field exposure levels, I. pallida growth was not distinguishable from that of control plants that received no extract, showing that indirect competition for resources was more important for determining the growth of I. pallida than direct allelopathic inhibition by A. petiolata. This is an important reminder that, even though many plants have the demonstrated potential to exert strong allelopathic effects, those effects may not always be apparent when other forms of competition are considered as well.",Web of Science,Alliaria petiolata,USA,,,,,Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Novel Weapons,,primary

Typically, these invaders have entomophilous flowers which are visited by a diverse array of pollinators. The type of breeding system and the role that pollination services play in the reproductive success of invasive plants have, however, received little attention. We studied the breeding system and pollen limitation of two entomophilous invasive plants, Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta, in different Mediterranean coastal localities in north-eastern Spain. Both species are, to some degree self-compatible; however, because of frequent visitation, open pollination increased the seed set in both species by at least 50%. Whereas O. stricta showed no pollen limitation, some populations of C. aff. acinaciformis had a lower seed set in open-pollinated flowers than in flowers where supplementary hand-pollination ensured out-crossing. This local pollen limitation in C. aff. acinaciformis could be due to the low efficiency of its visitors (mainly beetles) or its hybrid status. On the basis of previous studies on Carpobrotus sp. hybrid complexes, we suggest that the variability among sites in the seed set of open-pollinated flowers is caused by different degrees of hybrid introgression. Not withstanding, we found the C. aff. acinaciformis seed sets studied were higher than those reported in other regions.

Interactions between resident and exotic species have been shown to control the biotic resistance of communities to invasion. With different life stages of the exotic species, each sequential interaction may dampen or strengthen previous ones, thereby influencing invasion success. 2. We assessed the effects of resident vegetation type on the arrival and performance of Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow), a widespread invader in freshwater floating marshes, using a combination of field studies and glasshouse experiments. 3. Our results indicated that Triadica abundance was positively associated with native woody species, particularly the native actinorhizal shrub Morella cerifera (wax myrtle). Seed dispersal and germination of Triadica were generally low but suggestive that Morella has weak, facilitative effects on the spread of Triadica by channelling its dispersal by birds into shrub thickets and promoting germination upon arrival. Triadica seedling growth was greatest where light and total inorganic N were higher. Growth of Triadica trees was greater in marsh sites without Morella and did not exhibit any detectable responses to elevated N levels in substrates from Morella thickets. 4. Morella may facilitate the spread of Triadica in floating shrub communities, yet inhibit its growth once established. The few individuals that establish in herbaceous marshes grow faster and may therefore reach maturity sooner than in Morella shrub thickets. 5. Synthesis.

Current European, North American and Australian distributions were projected. Future Australian distributions were modelled using four climate change scenarios for 2030. The invasive climatic niche of H. murorum is primarily a subset of that expressed in its native range. Invasive populations of H. aurantiacum and H. pilosella occupy different climatic niches to those realized in their native ranges. Furthermore, geographically separate invasive populations of these two species have distinct climatic niches. ENMs calibrated on the realized niche of native regions projected smaller distributions than models incorporating data from species' entire ranges, and failed to correctly predict many known invasive populations. Under future climate scenarios, projected distributions decreased by similar percentages, regardless of the data used to calibrate ENMs; however, the overall sizes of projected distributions varied substantially. This study provides quantitative evidence that invasive populations of Hieracium species can occur in areas with different climatic conditions than experienced in their native ranges. For these, and similar species, calibration of ENMs based on NR data only will misrepresent their potential invasive distribution. These errors will propagate when estimating climate change impacts. Thus, incorporating data from species' entire distributions may result in a more thorough assessment of current and future ranges, and provides a closer approximation of the elusive fundamental niche.",Web of Science,Hieracium aurantiacum;Hieracium  murorum;Hieracium  pilosella ,,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Preadaptation to Climate,,

We evaluated the effect of vertebrate herbivory on the seedling survival of two widely planted and invasive tree species (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus), in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem of central Chile. An important role of herbivory on seedling survival of these two species in their introduced ranges has previously been documented. However, this has mainly been evaluated in forest plantations where habitat and vegetation conditions differ from wild habitats in which invasion occurs. We planted seedlings with and without protection against vertebrate herbivores in different aspects (a mesic south-facing slope and a xeric north-facing slope) and vegetation cover (open sites and sites with patchy tree cover). We found that regardless of aspect or vegetation cover, herbivory, in this case mainly caused by exotic vertebrates, significantly and negatively affected seedling survival of both species. However, while the effect of herbivory on P. radiata was significant in every vegetation and habitat condition, for E. globulus, the effect of herbivory was significant only for open sites in the mesic habitat. These results suggest that, as observed in forestry plantations, vertebrate herbivory may constrain seedling establishment of these two exotic trees and potentially impede the invasion. However, the importance of herbivory in controlling exotic species may vary depending on the vegetation and habitat conditions in some species such as E. globulus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Following establishment, increased resource availability may also facilitate the spread of exotic plant species if it enhances their competitive abilities relative to native species. Exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) introduce both exotic grass seed and nutrients to an endangered plant community on the Gulf Islands of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. I used greenhouse experiments to assess the competitive advantage of the exotic grasses relative to native and exotic forbs in this community and to test the impacts of nutrient addition from goose feces on competitive outcomes. I grew experimental communities varying in their proportion of forbs versus exotic grasses, and added goose feces as a nutrient source. I found that both native and exotic forbs produced significantly more biomass in competition with conspecifics than in competition with the grasses, and that the proportional abundance of two out of three native forbs was lowest in the combined presence of exotic grasses and nutrient addition. In a second experiment, I found that in monoculture all species of forbs and grasses showed equal growth responses to nutrients. The exotic species did not convert additional nutrients into additional biomass at a higher rate, but did germinate earlier and grow larger than the native species regardless of nutrient availability. This suggests that the exotic species may have achieved their competitive advantage partly by pre-empting resources in community mixtures. Small and late-germinating native forbs may be particularly vulnerable to competitive suppression from exotic grasses and forbs and may be at an even greater disadvantage if their competitors are benefiting from early access to additional nutrients. In combination, the input of exotic propagules and additional nutrients by nesting geese may compromise efforts to maintain native community composition in this system.",Web of Science,Branta canadensis; Bromus diandrus; Aira praecox; Vulpia bromoides; Poa annua; Senecio vulgaris,Canada,British Colombia,Gulf Islands,48.683053,-123.383603,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Savanna,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary;herbivore

Though examples of mutually beneficial interactions between exotic species are known, few studies have quantified these effects or identified specific mechanisms. We used the co-invasion of an endangered island ecosystem by exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and nine exotic annual grasses to study the effects of an invading herbivore on the success of invading grasses. On our study islands in southwestern Canada, we found that geese fed selectively on the exotic grasses and avoided native forbs. Counter to current theory suggesting that the grasses should be limited by a selective enemy, however, the grasses increased in proportional abundance under grazing whereas forbs showed declining abundance. Testing potential mechanisms for the effects of grazing on grasses, we found that the grasses produced more stems per area when grazing reduced vegetation height and prevented litter accumulation. Forming dense mats of short stems appeared to be an efficient reproductive and competitive strategy that the Eurasian grasses have evolved in the presence of grazers, conferring a competitive advantage in a system where the native species pool has very few annual grasses and no grazers. Germination trials further demonstrated that selective herbivory by geese enables their dispersal of exotic grass seed between heavily invaded feeding areas and the small islands used for nesting. In summary, the exotic geese facilitated both the local increase and the spatial spread of exotic grasses, which in turn provided the majority of their diet.

Although many invasive species undergo genetic bottlenecks during introduction to new areas resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, successful invaders manage to flourish in novel environments either because of pre-adaptations or because important traits contain adaptive variation enabling rapid adaptation to changing conditions. To predict and understand invasion success, it is crucial to analyse these features. We assessed the potential of a well-known invader, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), to expand north of its current range in Europe. A short growing season and harsh overwintering conditions are apparent limiting factors for this species' range. By rearing full-sib families from four geographically distinct populations (Russia, Estonia, Poland, Italy) at two fluctuating temperature regimes, we investigated (a) possible differences in survival, development time, and body size among populations and (b) the amount of adaptive variation within populations in these traits. All populations were able to complete their development in cooler conditions than in their current range. A significant genotype-environment interaction for development time and body size suggests the presence of adaptive genetic variation, indicating potential to adapt to cooler conditions. The northernmost population had the highest survival rates and fastest development times on both temperature regimes, suggesting pre-adaptation to cooler temperatures. Other populations had minor differences in development times. Interestingly, this species lacks the classical trade-off between body size and development time which could have contributed to its invasion potential.

Neophytes (alien species introduced after 1500) were very strongly associated with urban land cover in both time periods and do not appear to be spreading out of urban habitats into the wider countryside. Archaeophytes (alien species introduced before 1500), however, showed a strong association with urban habitats in the earlier 1988 data set but no longer showed this association in the 2004 data set. Analysis at the individual species level showed that a large percentage of alien plant species, particularly archaeophytes, were not strongly associated with urban land cover or were negatively associated with such habitats. Our results suggest that there has been a reduction in the urban association of archaeophytes that is likely to have resulted from the recovery of archaeophytes associated with non-urban (especially arable) habitats, following their decline in mid-20th century, rather than from the movement of aliens into the wider countryside from urban habitats.",Web of Science,Many,UK,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Changing climate creates risk as new terrain becomes climatically suitable for invasion. However, climate change may also create opportunities for ecosystem restoration on invaded lands that become climatically unsuitable for invasive species. Here, I develop a bioclimatic envelope model for cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a non-native invasive grass in the western US, based on its invaded distribution. The bioclimatic envelope model is based on the Mahalanobis distance using the climate variables that best constrain the species' distribution. Of the precipitation and temperature variables measured, the best predictors of cheatgrass are summer, annual, and spring precipitation, followed by winter temperature. I perform a sensitivity analysis on potential cheatgrass distributions using the projections of 10 commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for 2100. The AOGCM projections for precipitation vary considerably, increasing uncertainty in the assessment of invasion risk. Decreased precipitation, particularly in the summer, causes an expansion of suitable land area by up to 45%, elevating invasion risk in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. Conversely, increased precipitation reduces habitat by as much as 70%, decreasing invasion risk. The strong influence of precipitation conditions on this species' distribution suggests that relying on temperature change alone to project future change in plant distributions may be inadequate.

The urgency and scale of the global biodiversity crisis requires the application of generalized predictors of a species' likelihood of going extinct or becoming invasive in non-native areas. A common approach is to correlate species' ecological and life-history characteristics (attributes, traits) with the probability of becoming either threatened (responding negatively to human activity), or invasive (responding positively). The limitation of previous studies is that the fates of becoming threatened or invasive have generally been treated in isolation. 2. Here we consider the problem of threat and invasiveness in unison based on analysis of one of the largest-ever species attributes data bases (8906 species) compiled for a single plant family (Fabaceae). We used generalized linear mixed-effects models (using taxonomic grouping to control for within-family phylogenetic relationships) to correlate species' life-history and ecological traits to three response variables: probability of being (i) threatened or not, (ii) invasive or not, and (iii) threatened or invasive. 3. We found that tall, annual, range-restricted species with tree-like growth forms, inhabiting closed-forest and lowland sites are more likely to be threatened. Conversely, climbing and herbaceous species that naturally span multiple floristic kingdoms and habitat types are more likely to become invasive. 4. Synthesis. These results support the idea that at least for one of the richest plant families, species' life-history and ecological traits correlate with a fate response to anthropogenic global change. Our results show that species do demonstrate particular susceptibility to either fate based on their evolved traits, and that traits generally correlated with invasiveness are also those that correlate with a reduced probability of becoming threatened.",Web of Science,Many,,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,primary

The Argentine ant is a particularly well-studied invader, in part because of the extreme social structure of introduced populations, known as unicoloniality. Unicolonial ants form geographically vast supercolonies, within which territorial behaviour and intraspecific aggression are absent. Because the extreme social structure of introduced populations arises from the widespread acceptance of conspecifics, understanding how this colonymate recognition occurs is key to explaining their success as invaders. Here, we present analyses of Argentine ant recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons) and population genetic characteristics from 25 sites across four continents and the Hawaiian Islands. By examining both hydrocarbon profiles and microsatellite genotypes in the same individual ants, we show that native and introduced populations differ in several respects. Both individual workers and groups of nestmates in the introduced range possess less diverse chemical profiles than ants in the native range. As previous studies have reported, we also find that introduced populations possess much lower levels of genetic diversity than populations in the native range. Interestingly, the largest supercolonies on several continents are strikingly similar to each other, suggesting that they arose from a shared introduction pathway. This high similarity suggests that these geographically far-flung ants may still recognize and accept each other as colonymates, thus representing distant nodes of a single, widely distributed supercolony. These findings shed light on the behaviour and sociality of these unicolonial invaders, and pose new questions about the history and origins of introduced populations.",Web of Science,Linepithema humile,USA; Spain; Australia,California; Hawaii; North Carolona; Catalonia,,,,Field - Observational;Lab,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,omnivore

Most ecological studies have focused on morphological differences and changes in community dynamics, and physiological studies have typically explored the differences between native and invasive species. In this study, 15 different genotypes of Phalaris arundinacea from both its native (European) and invasive (North American) range were grown in a common garden experiment to monitor the physiological differences between native and invasive genotypes. Here we present data that suggests high variability exists in the physiological traits among genotypes of P. arundinacea, yet genotypes from the native range are not necessarily physiologically inferior to the hybridized invasive genotypes. Previous work has shown that multiple introductions of P. arundinacea from various European locations to the United States resulted in numerous hybridization events, yielding more genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity in the invasive range. Of the genotypes studied, both morphological and physiological traits of genotypes with French origin were significantly different from the plants from the Czech Republic, North Carolina, and Vermont. The lack of clear differences between native and invasive genotypes indicates that physiological traits may be highly conserved in P. arundinacea and enhanced photosynthetic rates are not indicative of successful invasive genotypes. Instead, morphological traits and defensive secondary compound metabolism may play a more important role in the success of P. arundinacea within its invasive range, and patterns of genetic variation in physiological traits between invasive and native range may be more important than the mean traits of each region when explaining reed canarygrass' invasive potential in North America.",Web of Science,Phalaris arundinacea,USA,North Carolina; Vermont,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

We propose an alternative approach that involves fitting models with pooled data from all ranges. We show that this pooled approach improves prediction of the extent of invasion of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in North America on models based solely on the European native range. Furthermore, it performs equally well on models based on the invaded range, while ensuring the inclusion of areas with similar climate to the European niche, where the species is likely to spread further. We then compare projections from these models for 2080 under a severe climate warming scenario.

In order to gain insight into the invasive mechanism of Centaurea stoebe we compared plants of three geo-cytotypes, native Eurasian diploids, native Eurasian tetraploids and introduced North American tetraploids, grown in a common greenhouse environment. We monitored plant performance characteristics and life cycle habits and characterized the expression of genes related to constitutive defense and genome stability using quantitative PCR. Results: Plant origin and ploidy were found to have a significant effect on both life cycle characteristics and gene expression, highlighting the importance of comparing appropriate taxonomic groups in studies of native and introduced plant species. We found that introduced populations of C. stoebe exhibit reduced expression of transcripts related to constitutive defense relative to their native tetraploid counterparts, as might be expected based on ideas of enemy release and rapid evolution. Measurements of several vegetative traits were similar for all geocytotypes; however, fecundity of tetraploids was significantly greater than diploids, due in part to their polycarpic nature. A simulation of seed production over time predicts that introduced tetraploids have the highest fecundity of the three geo- cytotypes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that characterizing gene expression in an invasive species using populations from both its native and introduced range can provide insight into the biology of plant invasion that can complement traditional measurements of plant performance.

The search for general characteristics of invasive species has not been very successful yet. A reason for this could be that current invasion patterns are mainly reflecting the introduction history (i.e. time since introduction and propagule pressure) of the species. Accurate data on the introduction history are, however, rare, particularly for introduced alien species that have not established. As a consequence, few studies that tested for the effects of species characteristics on invasiveness corrected for introduction history. 2. We tested whether the naturalization success of 582 North American woody species in Europe, measured as the proportion of European geographic regions in which each species is established, can be explained by their introduction history. For 278 of these species we had data on characteristics related to growth form, life cycle, growth, fecundity and environmental tolerance. We tested whether naturalization success can be further explained by these characteristics. In addition, we tested whether the effects of species characteristics differ between growth forms. 3. Both planting frequency in European gardens and time since introduction significantly increased naturalization success, but the effect of the latter was relatively weak. After correction for introduction history and taxonomy, six of the 26 species characteristics had significant effects on naturalization success. Leaf retention and precipitation tolerance increased naturalization success. Tree species were only 56% as likely to naturalize as non-tree species (vines, shrubs and subshrubs), and the effect of planting frequency on naturalization success was much stronger for non-trees than for trees. On the other hand, the naturalization success of trees, but not for non-trees, increased with native range size, maximum plant height and seed spread rate. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that introduction history, particularly planting frequency, is an important determinant of current naturalization success of North American woody species (particularly of non-trees) in Europe. Therefore, studies comparing naturalization success among species should correct for introduction history.

We asked if the degree to which non-native plant species are phylogenetically related is a predictor of invasion success at two spatial scales. Australia - the whole continent and Royal National Park (south-eastern Australia). We used non-native plant species occupancy in Royal National Park, as well as estimated continental occupancy of these species from herbarium records. We then estimated phylogenetic relationships using molecular data from three gene sequences available on GenBank (matK, rbcL and ITS1). We tested for phylogenetic signals in occupancy using Blomberg's K. Whereas most non-native plants were relatively scarce, there was a strong phylogenetic signal for continental occupancy, driven by the clustering of successful species in Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. However, we failed to detect a phylogenetic signal at the park scale. Our results reveal that at a large spatial scale, invader success is phylogenetically clustered where ecological traits promoting success appear to be shared among close relatives, indicating that phylogenetic relationships can be useful predictors of invasion success at large spatial scales. At a smaller, landscape scale, there was no evidence of phylogenetic clustering of invasion success, and thus, relatedness plays a much reduced role in determining the relative success of invaders.",Web of Science,Many,Australia,,Royal National Park,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,Grassland;Deciduous Forest;Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Preadaptation to Climate,,primary

Our results are discussed with respect to the refinement of the EICA hypothesis that takes into account the difference between specialist and generalist herbivores and between qualitative and quantitative defences.

For exotic predator species that feed on herbivores, their success with invading new habitats may depend upon overcoming defences used by native prey. Whether exotic predators can alter herbivore host choice has remained unexamined. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of larval defence by Chrysomela knabi (a native beetle species) that had fed on two native willow hosts: Salix sericea (a phenolic glycoside (PG)-rich species) and Salix eriocephala (a PG-poor species), when attacked by exotic generalist predators. In addition, the preference and performance of C. knabi on S. sericea and S. eriocephala was examined. 2 Chrysomela knabi preferred and performed better on S. sericea. In a common garden, adult C. knabi were nine-fold more common and oviposited five-fold more frequently on S. sericea than on S. eriocephala. In the laboratory, adult feeding preference on leaf discs and survival rates of larvae were both greater on S. sericea, and time to pupation was shorter. 3 Chrysomela knabi larvae produced significantly more salicylaldehyde when fed S. sericea leaves than when fed S. eriocephala leaves. Additionally, those larvae with greater salicylaldehyde had reduced predation by two exotic generalist predators, Harmonia axyridis larvae and juvenile Tenodera aridifolia sinensis. 4 The results obtained in the present study suggest that selection favoured the preference of C. knabi for PG-rich willow plants because larvae grew and survived better and that selection by common exotic generalist predators would reinforce this preference.",Web of Science,Harmonia axyridis,USA,New York,Milford,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Riparian,Impacts;Fundamentals,,,herbivore

To distinguish between the function of roadsides as movement corridors and as habitat, nonnative plant species were surveyed along roads in deciduous forest sites in southeastern Ohio, USA. The importance of road proximity was tested by comparing nonnative species abundance in 100 m transects along roads with transects in undisturbed forest. Nonnative species were most abundant and most frequently observed in roadside sites in valleys. Three common species were chosen for closer scrutiny. In a seed sowing experiment roads and open sites proved to be better locations for the germination and growth of Microstegium vimineum than non-roadside and closed-canopy sites. Tussilago farfara and Rosa multiflora occurred in a small number of disjunct patches suggesting infrequent arrival in the sampled transects. Both species were strongly clustered at scales consistent with diffusive spread by vegetative growth and short-range seed dispersal. Comparisons of distributions parallel and perpendicular to roads showed no evidence for enhanced dispersal along the road axis. Microstegium distributions were correlated with local light availability implying site saturation. Microstegium micro-distributions suggested that spread along the road axis was facilitated by movement of dormant seeds in road maintenance. Thus, roadsides appear to function as both habitat and a conduit for population expansion, with the rate of spread dependent on the life history of the individual species.

Hoffm. (Marattiaceae), has its native range in the South Pacific. This species has been introduced into other localities since the 18th century and is now listed as an invasive species in several regions (Jamaica, Hawaii and Costa Rica). The purpose of our study is (1) to trace the distributional history of the species, and (2) to model its potential future range based on climatic conditions. The native range and the history of introduction are based on the existing literature and on 158 specimens from 15 herbaria, together with field observations. As there are taxonomic problems surrounding A. evecta, we limited our analysis to samples from the Pacific, most closely resembling the type from Tahiti. We modelled the potential range using GARP species distribution modelling with basic climatic variables, elevation, and location in relation to the coast. Analysis of past records shows that the species is able to colonise new ecosystems with relative ease. The modelling reveals that the species could be cultivated over a much wider range than where it currently is grown. The escape of cultivated plants into nature is probably due to distance from natural areas and is limited by local ecological factors, such as soil conditions or competitors. The predicted distribution in Asia and Madagascar is similar to the native distribution of the entire genus Angiopteris. It can therefore be assumed that most Angiopteris species have similar climatic preferences, and the absence of A. evecta in this predicted region may be due to dispersal limitation. In the Americas there is no native Angiopteris, but our climatic model predicts a vast potential habitat in tropical America; an invasion of A. evecta should be anticipated here in localities where the species is cultivated. Vessel ferns are known to alter the natural environment, which may reduce local biodiversity. Since A. evecta is not yet widely cultivated, it is advisable to restrict the trade and spread of the species and to discourage its cultivation as an ornamental. The global climate data available for modelling is however not detailed enough to predict the spread of A. evecta on a local or regional scale.",Web of Science,Angiopteris evecta,many,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Preadaptation to Climate,,primary

Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe. European Union and some adjacent countries. We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class.

The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe.

In this study, we hypothesized that Norway maple would have less insect damage than sugar maple due to such enemy release.

Therefore, according to EICA, introduced genotypes are expected to grow more vigorously than conspecific native genotypes when cultivated under common standardized conditions. The EICA hypothesis also assumes that herbivores will perform better on introduced genotypes compared to native genotypes, because they are less well defended. However, selection for either defense or growth will depend on the type of defense (quantitative or qualitative) employed by the plant, and whether the plant is released from generalist or specialist herbivores. The predictions of the EICA hypothesis might be reversed if a plant experiences increased generalist herbivore pressure in the introduced range, and therefore invests more ill qualitative defense. We examined this idea with the invasive perennial mustard, Lepidium draba. We grew a total of 16 populations of L. draba from both its native European and introduced western US ranges under common conditions in a greenhouse. We also tested for differences ill plant resistance to the specialist herbivore, Psylliodes wrasei, by conducting a leaf disc feeding bioassay with native and introduced L. draba genotypes. Furthermore, we quantified the generalist herbivore load on L. draba in both ranges in order to assess the selection pressure for increased qualitative defense. Contrary to the original EICA prediction, all plant traits (biomass. number of shoots, length and diameter of longest leaf) tended to be greater for the native, rather than introduced L. draba genotypes. There was no significant difference in the proportion of leaf area consumed by the specialist herbivore between native and introduced genotypes. The generalist herbivore load oil L. draba was significantly greater in the introduced range. Our data Suggest that the EICA hypothesis does not explain the invasion success of L. draba in the US. Instead, we propose that the reduced vigor or introduced genotypes may be due to selection for increased defense against generalist herbivores in the introduced range.

We argue that anthropogenic transport represents the most likely mechanism driving this spread, although rafting may offer an alternative explanation for the observed distribution.",Web of Science,Nematostella vectensis,USA,,,,,Field - Observational,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,omnivore

We also obtained data on planting effort for 26 species, from historical records. Linear and generalized linear models were used to analyse the relationships between invasiveness, herbivory and taxonomic isolation. Mean proportion of leaves damaged per species was significantly explained by taxonomic isolation; proportion of leaves damaged increased with the number of native confamilial species and was greater, on average, for species with native congeners than those without native congeners. The mean percentage of leaf area damaged per species could not be explained by any variables considered in this study. There was no relationship between the degree of herbivory or taxonomic isolation and alien plant species invasiveness, but more-invasive species did have a significantly greater planting effort than less-invasive species. The role herbivores play in controlling alien plant invasions has been investigated relatively little in the tropics.

PIER provides data on the distribution of naturalized non-native plant species thought to pose environmental or economic risk. We hypothesized that the numbers of PIER-listed species would be positively correlated with island size, habitat diversity, and proximity to major source pools for propagules. Further, we expected numbers of PIER-listed exotic species to be similar among islands in the same country and to be greater where human populations were larger and where economic activity was high. Most species (908) were found on <= 10 islands. Species number was significantly correlated with island and country areas and with native plant species richness. The strongest model revealed by AICc analyses of island data included log (area) and maximum elevation as well as country membership, substrate type, and presence of an airport with paved runway (an index of economic activity). By country, AICc analyses revealed two equivalent models, both of which included log (area) and per capita gross domestic product as well as a measure of population size (either log (population size) or (population density)).

In this study, the impact of smooth brome on the patch dynamics of a dominant native grass species, Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass), was assessed using fine-scale (sub-meter) mapping of the distribution of cordgrass and brome in three prairie fragments from 2000 to 2006. Using GIS spatial analyses, we determined that cordgrass patch growth was two times greater in areas not invaded by smooth brome versus areas that were heavily infested with smooth brome. Among sites and time periods, there was a consistent significant negative relationship between the amount of smooth brome surrounding a patch of cordgrass and the growth of that cordgrass patch. The probability of establishment of a new patch of cordgrass averaged 1.3 times higher in areas of low brome coverage (< 25%) than areas of high brome coverage (> 75%). Conversely, existing cordgrass patches were 7.8 times more likely to go extinct in areas of high than low brome coverage.

The primary described mechanism of seed dispersal is through consumption of fruits by birds and mammals. We evaluated an alternative dispersal method by evaluating the potential for S. terebinthifolius growing in freshwater and estuarine environments to disperse via water currents. Specifically, we: (1) determined the duration fruits remained buoyant in three salinities, (2) estimated the viability of seeds after 7 days in water, (3) estimated the dispersal rate of floating solitary fruits, and (4) examined the role of boat wakes in moving seeds above mean high water at the shoreline. The length of time fruits floated in 0 ppt water (4.9 days) was significantly less than 15 ppt saltwater (6.2 days), and 30 ppt saltwater (6.9 days). After 7 days, over 13% of seeds remained viable in 0 ppt, 15 ppt, and 30 ppt water. By combining mean dispersal rates and the mean number of days fruits floated, we calculated individual fruits could be transported 16.9 km in 0 ppt and over 22 km in 15 and 30 ppt water. To increase germination, seeds must be stranded above the intertidal zone. Wind wakes alone never achieved this result; however, boat wakes plus wind wakes significantly increased the movement of fruits above the intertidal region into drier soils.

Presumably, no resistance has evolved among the native species to this new allelochemical (i.e., the novel weapon). In their native habitat, however, the plants that co-evolved with these invasive species have theoretically evolved defenses that obviate the allelochemical advantage. Previous studies have claimed that catechin is such a novel weapon of spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe = C. maculosa), an invasive species in the non-native habitat of North America. These studies indicated that (-)-catechin is more phytotoxic than (+)-catechin. Other studies have not found sufficient catechin in field soils to support this theory. We report that (-)-catechin and (+)-catechin are essentially equal, but poorly phytotoxic to a variety of plant species in bioassays without soil. In a dose/response experiment with Montana soils, we found the lowest dose for a growth reduction of two native Montana grasses (Koeleria macrantha and Festuca idahoensis) by a racemic mixture of (+/-)-catechin that ranged from about 25 to 50 mM, concentrations, orders of magnitude higher than expected in nature. Autoclaving the soil before adding the catechin did not affect the activity of catechin. We found (-)-catechin to be a potent antioxidant, in contrast to a previous claim that it acts as an allelochemical by causing oxidative stress.

These effects might be intensified by artificial selection in the course of breeding efforts, since many successful plant invaders were deliberately introduced and cultivated as ornamentals. We hypothesized that the invasion success of Buddleja davidii, the ornamental butterfly bush, is facilitated by local adaptation to minimum temperatures and thus, exhibits unpredictable range dynamics. To assess the potential effects of adaptive evolution and artificial selection on the spread of B. davidii, we combined a common garden experiment investigating local adaptation to frost, with ecological niche modelling of the species' native and invasive ranges. We expected that populations naturalized in sub-continental climate are less susceptible to frost than populations from oceanic climate, and that the invasive range does not match predictions based on climatic data from the native range. Indeed, we revealed significant variation among invasive B. davidii populations in frost resistance. However, frost hardiness was not related to geographic location or climatic variables of the populations' home site, suggesting that invasive B. davidii populations are not locally adapted to minimum temperatures. This is in line with results of our ecological niche model that did not detect a niche shift between the species' native range in China, and its invasive range in Europe and North America. Furthermore, our niche model showed that the potential invasive range of B. davidii is still not completely occupied. Together with the frost resistance data obtained in our experiment, the results indicate that climatic conditions are currently not limiting the further spread of the species in Europe and North America.",Web of Science,Buddleja davidii,Germany,,Halle,51.489664,11.961178,Theoretical/Modeling;Garden,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

This study aimed, for the first time, to address the importance of propagule pressure and disturbance by examining the spread of an introduced tree, Cordia alliodora, from a single plantation into a surrounding mosaic of humid forest in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. By assessing vulnerability to invasion along transects radiating from the plantation, the effects of distance (measure of propagule pressure), and disturbance could be discerned. For all life stages, distance from source population was the strongest correlate of density. A marked influence of disturbance was only evident for C. alliodora seedlings. Spatial variation in the densities of later life stages may be a function of past disturbances, less easy to assess from current surveys, especially following the marked self-thinning between seedling and adult densities. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that propagule pressure is a more important determinant of Cordia density than disturbance. If this is true for other alien tree species in tropical forests, controlling for introduction effort is essential to assess the drivers of plant invasion.

Wetlands in urban regions are subjected to a wide variety of anthropogenic disturbances, many of which may promote invasions of exotic plant species. In order to devise management strategies, the influence of different aspects of the urban and natural environments on invasion and community structure must be understood. 2. The roles of soil variables, anthropogenic effects adjacent to and within the wetlands, and vegetation structure on exotic species occurrence within 21 forested wetlands in north-eastern New Jersey, USA, were compared. The hypotheses were tested that different vegetation strata and different invasive species respond similarly to environmental factors, and that invasion increases with increasing direct human impact, hydrologic disturbance, adjacent residential land use and decreasing wetland area. Canonical correspondence analyses, correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to examine invasion by individual species and overall site invasion, as measured by the absolute and relative number of exotic species in the site flora. 3. Within each stratum, different sets of environmental factors separated exotic and native species. Nutrients, soil clay content and pH, adjacent land use and canopy composition were the most frequently identified factors affecting species, but individual species showed highly individualistic responses to the sets of environmental variables, often responding in opposite ways to the same factor. 4. Overall invasion increased with decreasing area but only when sites > 100 ha were included. Unexpectedly, invasion decreased with increasing proportions of industrial/commercial adjacent land use. 5. The hypotheses were only partially supported; invasion does not increase in a simple way with increasing human presence and disturbance. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that a suite of environmental conditions can be identified that are associated with invasion into urban wetlands, which can be widely used for assessment and management. However, a comprehensive ecosystem approach is needed that places the remediation of physical alterations from urbanization within a landscape context.

The EICA hypothesis considered levels of defensive chemistry to be fixed within a particular genotype. In this paper, we propose that if herbivory is reduced in the introduced range, but chemical defenses are inducible in response to herbivory, evolution of reduced defenses and any associated increase competitive ability should not occur. Rather, mean induced and constitutive levels of induced defenses should be similar in introduced and native ranges, but the variance about mean induced levels should be greater in the introduced range. This is predicted because induced levels will occur less frequently in the introduced range where herbivory is reduced, thereby insulating these levels from the stabilizing selection expected in the native range where induced levels occur more frequently. We conducted a preliminary study to examine this by comparing constitutive and induced concentrations of total pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from native (European) and introduced (western North America) populations of Cynoglossum officinale L. The mean constitutive and induced concentrations of PAs did not differ between continents, but the variability of the induced concentrations was significantly greater for plants from the introduced range. Although our study with C. officinale is provisional due to a small sample size, it supports our predictions for evolution of inducible defenses in introduced ranges where herbivore pressure is reduced. Most chemical defenses in plants have been found to be inducible, so similar patterns may occur widely. If so, this weakens the generality of EICA's predictions concerning chemical defenses.

Despite the pressing management implications, the mechanisms that control exotic plant invasion remain poorly understood. Several factors, such as disturbance, propagule pressure, species diversity, and herbivory, are widely believed to play a critical role in exotic plant invasions. However, few studies have examined the relative importance of these factors, and little is known about how propagule pressure interacts with various mechanisms of ecological resistance to determine invasion success. We quantified the relative importance of canopy disturbance, propagule pressure, species diversity, and herbivory in determining exotic plant invasion in 10 eastern hemlock forests in Pennsylvania and New Jersey (USA). Use of a maximum-likelihood estimation framework and information theoretics allowed us to quantify the strength of evidence for alternative models of the influence of these factors on changes in exotic plant abundance. In addition, we developed models to determine the importance of interactions between ecosystem properties and propagule pressure. These analyses were conducted for three abundant, aggressive exotic species that represent a range of life histories: Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii, and Microstegium vimineum. Of the four hypothesized determinants of exotic plant invasion considered in this study, canopy disturbance and propagule pressure appear to be the most important predictors of A. petiolata, B. thunbergii, and M. vimineum invasion. Herbivory was also found to be important in contributing to the invasion of some species. In addition, we found compelling evidence of an important interaction between propagule pressure and canopy disturbance. This is the first study to demonstrate the dominant role of the interaction between canopy disturbance and propagule pressure in determining forest invasibility relative to other potential controlling factors. The importance of the disturbance-propagule supply interaction, and its nonlinear functional form, has profound implications for the management of exotic plant species populations.

To test this hypothesis, we determined N allocation and other ecophysiological traits of three invasive species in comparison with their respective native congeners by measuring response curves of photosynthesis to intercellular CO2 concentration. The invasive species of Peperomia and Piper indeed allocated a higher fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis and were more efficient in photosynthetic N (N-P) partitioning than their native congeners. The two invasive species partitioned a higher fraction of N-P to carboxylation and showed a higher use efficiency of N-P, while their native congeners partitioned a higher fraction of N-P to light-harvesting components. The higher N allocation to photosynthesis and the higher N-P partitioning to carboxylation in the two invaders were associated with their higher specific leaf area. Nitrogen allocation and partitioning were the most important factors in explaining the differences in light-saturated photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) between the two invasive species and their native congeners. The differences in N allocation-related variables between the invasive and native species of Amaranthus could not be evaluated in this study due to the method.

This increased vigor in invasive populations is thought to be due to life history tradeoffs, in which selection favors the loss of costly defense traits, thereby freeing resources that can be devoted to increased growth or fecundity. Despite the theoretical importance of such allocation shifts for invasions, there have been no efforts to understand apparent evolutionary shifts in defense-growth allocation mechanistically. Reallocation of nitrogen (N) to photosynthesis is likely to play a crucial role in any growth increase; however, no study has been conducted to explore potential evolutionary changes in N allocation of introduced plants. Here, we show that introduced Ageratina adenophora, a noxious invasive plant throughout the subtropics, appears to have evolved increased N allocation to photosynthesis (growth) and reduced allocation to cell walls, resulting in poorer structural defenses.

We considered densities of both L. lucidum and the other ornithochorous plant species that bear fruit simultaneously with L. lucidum, as variables that could influence fruit removal of this species. We sampled three small (0.5-5 ha), two medium fragments (10-30ha), and two continuous forests (more than 1000ha). The percentage of fruits removed per tree was higher in small fragments than in medium or large ones. We did not find significant differences in plant density between fragments of different size neither for L. lucidum nor for the other ornithochorous plant species. During the effective removal period of L. lucidum (i.e., when animals removed fruits), the other ornithochorous plant species did not offer fruits. This region is affected by an increasing fragmentation process, where continuous woodlands have been reduced to small fragments. Considering that the main result is higher fruit removal in small fragments, new studies on the ecology of this species are needed if Chaco dry forests are to be conserved.

Differences in fitness among areas of introduction can define the zones where aliens become invasive. The American slider turtle Trachemys scripta has been introduced worldwide, and has negative effects on freshwater communities, but only a subset of introduced populations breed successfully. We used species distribution models to assess the factors influencing the slider distribution in Italy, by analysing bioclimatic features that can cause the transition from presence of feral adults to breeding populations. We also evaluated whether climate change might increase the future suitability for reproduction. Central and Northern Italy. The distribution of slider turtle was obtained from the literature, unpublished reports and field surveys. We used Maxent to build bioclimatic models. Reproductive populations are associated to a clear bioclimatic envelope with warmer climate, more solar radiation and higher precipitations than populations where reproduction is not observed. Several Mediterranean areas currently have climatic features suitable for sliders. Scenarios of climate change predict the expansion of these areas. In the near future (2020), the proportion of populations in areas suitable for reproduction will dramatically increase. Our study shows that bioclimatic differences can determine the areas where aliens become invaders. Management should be focused to these source areas.

M.",2008,Patterns of alien plant distribution in a river landscape following an extreme flood,journal,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,74,3,463,475,"The availability of suitable patches and gaps in the landscape is a crucial determinant of invasibility for alien plants. The type and arrangement of patches in the landscape may both facilitate and obstruct alien plant invasions, depending on whether alien species perceive the patches as barriers. In February 2000 tropical weather systems caused an extreme flood with an estimated return interval of 90 to 200 years in the Sabie River, South Africa. The impact of the 2000 flood on the Sabie River landscape provides an array of patches that may provide suitable resources for the establishment of alien plants. This study examines the distribution of alien plants in relation to patchiness of the Sabie River landscape. Our hypothesis was that if certain patches in the river landscape do not represent environmental barriers to alien plant invasion, alien species will occur preferentially in these patch types. The Sabie River within Kruger National Park [KNP] was divided into six patch types (zones, channel types, elevations, geomorphic units, substrates and flood imprint types). We then examined the distribution of native and alien woody and herbaceous density and species richness in patches. The density and species richness of alien plants in the Sabie River in KNP is very low when compared to the density and species richness of native plants. Some patches (bedrock distributary and braid bar geomorphic units) contained higher density and richness of alien plants compared to the other patches examined, indicating that these locations in the river landscape offer the resources necessary for alien plant establishment. Individual alien species are also associated with different parts of the river landscape. Failure of large numbers of alien plants to establish after the 2000 flood is most likely due to a combination of factors-the plant specific barriers imposed by landscape patchiness, the high abundance and richness of native vegetation leading to competition, and for some species certainly, the clearing by the management (Working for Water) programme.

In providing direction to managing alien plant invasions, much emphasis is placed on collecting spatially explicit data. However, insufficient thought is often given to how the data are to be used, frequently resulting in the incompatibility of the data for different uses. This paper explores the role of spatial scale in interpreting, managing and monitoring alien plant invasions in a large protected area. Kruger National Park, South Africa. Using 27,000 spatially-explicit records of invasive alien plants for the Kruger National Park (> 20,000 km(2)) we assessed alien plant species richness per cell at nine different scales of resolution. When assessing the patterns of alien plants at the various scales of resolution, almost identical results are obtained when working at scales of quarter-degree grids and quaternary watersheds (the fourth level category in South Africa's river basin classification system). Likewise, insights gained from working at resolutions of 0.1-0.5 km and 1-5 km are similar. At a scale of 0.1 x 0.1 km cells, only 0.4% of the Kruger National Park is invaded, whereas > 90% of the park is invaded when mapped at the quarter-degree cell resolution. Selecting the appropriate scale of resolution is crucial when evaluating the distribution and abundance of alien plant invasions, understanding ecological processes, and operationalizing management applications and monitoring strategies. Quarter-degree grids and quaternary watersheds are most useful at a regional or national scale. Grid cells of 1 to 25 km(2) are generally useful for establishing priorities for and planning management interventions.

Has logging disturbance facilitated the spread of Fraxinus and other alien species? Location: Windward Mauna Kea, island of Hawai'i. Methods: We surveyed 29 plots which were established before selective logging of the native tree Acacia koa in 1971 to determine if Fraxinus spread beyond the borders of an existing plantation and if other alien species increased. We created gaps in the canopy of the Fraxinus plantation and measured seed rain and regeneration, and we sampled foliar and soil nutrients inside and around the plantation. Results: Basal area of Fraxinus increased front 0.7 m(2).ha(-1) in 1971 to 10.8 m(2).ha (1) in 2000.

On 17 occasions between September 2005 and June 2006, we determined killing temperatures using freeze-induced electrolyte leakage and direct observation. In midwinter, cottonwood survived cooling to -70 degrees C, while saltcedar was killed at -33 to -47 degrees C. Frost sensitivity, therefore, may limit northward expansion of saltcedar in North America. Both species demonstrated inherited latitudinal variation in cold hardiness.

Phenotypic plasticity is often cited as an important mechanism of plant invasion. However, few studies have evaluated the plasticity of a diverse set of traits among invasive and native species, particularly in low resource habitats, and none have examined the functional significance of these traits. 2. I explored trait plasticity in response to variation in light and nutrient availability in five phylogenetically related pairs of native and invasive species occurring in a nutrient-poor habitat. In addition to the magnitude of trait plasticity, I assessed the correlation between 16 leaf- and plant-level traits and plant performance, as measured by total plant biomass. Because plasticity for morphological and physiological traits is thought to be limited in low resource environments (where native species usually display traits associated with resource conservation), I predicted that native and invasive species would display similar, low levels of trait plasticity. 3. Across treatments, invasive and native species within pairs differed with respect to many of the traits measured; however, invasive species as a group did not show consistent patterns in the direction of trait values. Relative to native species, invasive species displayed high plasticity in traits pertaining to biomass partitioning and leaf-level nitrogen and light use, but only in response to nutrient availability. Invasive and native species showed similar levels of resource-use efficiency and there was no relationship between species plasticity and resource-use efficiency across species. 4. Traits associated with carbon fixation were strongly correlated with performance in invasive species while only a single resource conservation trait was strongly correlated with performance in multiple native species. Several highly plastic traits were not strongly correlated with performance which underscores the difficulty in assessing the functional significance of resource conservation traits over short timescales and calls into question the relevance of simple, quantitative assessments of trait plasticity. 5. Synthesis. My data support the idea that invasive species display high trait plasticity. The degree of plasticity observed here for species occurring in low resource systems corresponds with values observed in high resource systems, which contradicts the general paradigm that trait plasticity is constrained in low resource systems. Several traits were positively correlated with plant performance suggesting that trait plasticity will influence plant fitness.",Web of Science,Leucaena leucocephala; Psidium cattleianum; Holcus lanatus; Paspalum urvillei; Rubus ellipticus,United States,Hawaii,"University of Hawaii, Volcano Agricultural Experiment Station",19.4667,-154.7333,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary

Range size was used as an estimation of the degree of invasion success of the species. To model variation in range size between species as a function of a set of species attributes, we adopted the framework of the generalized linear mixed models because they allow the incorporation of taxonomic categories as nested random factors to control for phylogenetic relationships. From the invaded site perspective, we determined invader plant species richness as the number of species for each 10 x 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid. For each grid cell, we estimated variables concerning landscape, topography, climate and human settlement. Then, we performed a generalized linear mixed model incorporating a defined spatial correlation structure to assess the relationship between plant invader richness and the environmental predictors.

From the invaded site perspective, we identified high anthropogenic disturbance, low altitude, short distance to the coastline and dry, hot weather as the main correlates to UTM grid cell invader richness.

The flowering patterns of invasive alien plant species and related natives were studied in three regions with Mediterranean-type climate: California, Spain and South Africa's Cape region. A total of 227 invasive-native pairs were compared for seven character types across the regions, with each pair selected on the basis that they shared the same habitat type within a region, had a common growth form and pollination type, and belonged to the same family or genus. Invasive alien plant species have different patterns of flowering phenology from native species in the three regions. Whether the alien species flower earlier, later or at the same time as natives depends on the climatic regime in the native range of the aliens and the proportion of species in the invasive floras originating from different regions. Species invading at least two of the regions displayed the same flowering pattern, showing that flowering phenology is a conservative trait. Invasive species with native ranges in temperate climates flower earlier than natives, those from Mediterranean-type climates at the same time, and species from tropical climates flower later. In California, where the proportion of invaders from the Mediterranean Basin is high, the flowering pattern did not differ between invasive and native species, whereas in Spain the high proportion of tropical species results in a later flowering than natives, and in the Cape region early flowering than natives was the result of a high proportion of temperate invaders. Observed patterns are due to the human-induced sympatry of species with different evolutionary histories whose flowering phenology evolved under different climatic regimes. The severity of the main abiotic filters imposed by the invaded regions (e.g. summer drought) has not been strong enough (yet) to shift the flowering pattern of invasive species to correspond with that of native relatives. It does, however, determine the length of the flowering season and the type of habitat invaded by summer-flowering aliens.

Competition from resident species and the interaction between resource limitation and competition have been overlooked as mechanisms of community resistance in refugia habitats. We examined the importance of these factors in determining the resistance of California serpentine plant communities to invasion by three common European grasses, Avena barbata, Bromus diandrus, and Hordeum murinum. We added seeds of each of these grasses to plots subjected to six levels of resource addition (N, P, Ca, H2O, all resources together, and a no-addition control) and two levels of competition (with resident community present or removed). Resource limitation and competition had strong effects on the biomass and reproduction of the three invaders. The addition of all resources together combined with the removal of the resident community yielded individual plants that were fourfold to 20-fold larger and sixfold to 20-fold more fecund than plants from control plots. Competitor removal alone yielded invaders that were twofold to sevenfold larger and twofold to ninefold more fecund. N addition alone or in combination with other resources led to a twofold to ninefold increase in the biomass and fecundity of the invaders. No other resource alone significantly affected native or invader performance, suggesting that N was the key limiting resource during our experiment. We found a significant interaction between abiotic and biotic resistance for Bromus, which experienced increased competitive suppression in fertilized plots. The threefold increase in resident biomass with N addition was likely responsible for this result. Our results confirm that serpentine plant communities are severely N limited, which, in combination with competition from resident species, promotes the resistance of these systems to invasions.

The Chilean matorral is highly invaded by alien plant species from other Mediterranean zones of the world, where natural, recurrent wildfires have been one of their ecological features at least since the Pliocene. This suggests that anthropogenic fires in Chile might favour alien plant recruitment, increasing the invasive process. We assessed the effect of litter burning on the emergence of alien and native species from the soil seedbank of a matorral of central Chile. Soil samples were taken from three types of microhabitats: (i) closed matorral; (ii) beneath the canopy of shrubs and trees from an open matorral; (iii) grassland. Each sample was split in two subsamples. One subsample was exposed to fire by burning the litter taken from its corresponding microhabitat, and the other subsample was left unburned and used as a control. Fire intensity, determined by the fuel type, affected more markedly the native seedbank survival than the alien one. The low-intensity fire produced by grassland litter did not significantly affect the emergence of native herbs but increased alien species richness. The high-intensity and the very high-intensity fires produced by litter burning from beneath the canopy of the closed and the open matorral, respectively, negatively affected the seedling emergence of both native and alien species, but did so in a more pronounced manner to native species. Therefore, anthropogenic fires in central Chile may promote the invasion of alien plants with favourable traits (i. e. heat-shock resistance of seeds) that are not present in the native flora.",Web of Science,Many,Chile,Santiago province,San Carlos de Apoquindo,-33.45,-70.42,Field - Experimental;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Grassland;Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Preadaptation to Climate;Disturbance,Superior Competitor;Broad Tolerances,primary

Manipulative experiments provide a means for discerning causal relationships and interactive effects of environmental factors in promoting invasion; such experiments have been conducted in a number of grassland and shrub ecosystems. This study extends multifactor manipulative experiments into forest communities to compare factors influencing early seedling establishment for native and invasive woody plants. In Long Island, NY, invasion patterns are correlated with forest community type (pine barrens or hardwood), light availability, and soil N and Ca. We conducted manipulative field experiments in two different years to determine the relative importance and interaction of experimental gaps and N and Ca addition in pine barrens and hardwood forests in promoting invasion. We used seedlings of seven common native and invasive species in the first experiment, and 16 native and invasive species paired phylogenetically in the second experiment. Light had the strongest effect on plant growth; all plants grew more in gaps. We found no difference in the average growth rates of native and invasive species. Invasives responded more to high resources than did natives, with highest relative growth rates in gaps in the more fertile soils of the hardwood forests.

It is, therefore, important to understand the mechanisms behind the dispersal of this species. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phylogeography and mechanisms underlying the recent expansion of C raciborskii into temperate latitudes, but there is still no conclusive evidence whether the obvious ecological success of C raciborskii is due to selection mechanisms, physiological tolerance, climatic change or radiation after the last ice age. In the present study, new isolates of C raciborskii from Europe and Africa were genetically characterised by sequencing the ITS1, PC-IGS, nifH and rpoC1 genes and compared to corresponding sequences of C raciborskii available in GenBank in order to test different phylogeographical hypotheses. The strains were also morphologically examined and screened for production of the hepatotoxic cylindrospermopsin (CYN). We clearly demonstrate a variation among the populations of C raciborskii from different geographical regions. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a clustering of the strains due to geographic origin. The ITS1 and nifH genes separated into American, European and Australian-African groups, whereas the PC-IGS and rpoC1 separated into American and European/Australian/African groups. An analysis of concatenated data supported the division into American, European and African/Australian groups, and even indicated a subdivision into an African and an Australian group. Our findings do not strongly support any of the existing hypotheses on the phylogeography of C raciborskii, and most likely a combination of these hypotheses is the best approach to understand the evolution and dispersal of this species.

Non-native fish species have steadily increased in Hokkaido since the mid 1970s, as indicated by the decreasing proportion of native fish species per fish survey. Non-native species richness was significantly higher in areas above dams (i.e., reservoirs and their inlet streams) compared to areas without dams. As a result, the proportion of native fish species was lower above dams. This proportion was lower in developed and agricultural areas compared with forest areas, although both native and non-native species richness were higher in areas with development and agriculture. Non-native cyprinids, catfish and snakehead occurred primarily in a particular river basin with the largest drainage area, the longest history of reclamation and highest human population in the island. Non-native salmonids on the other hand, occurred in forest areas at higher elevations and their occurrence was associated with the existence of dams. There was a spatial linkage between the distribution of dams and non-native species, although it was applicable only to salmonids.

Here, we experimentally explore how the presence of this alien ant species influences geckos foraging at flowers and fruits of R. simplex by removing and excluding ants from flowers and fruits. Gecko visitation rates to ant-free control flowers and fruits, and flowers and fruits where ants had been removed and excluded, were higher than those to ant-infested flowers and fruits. The resulting seed set of ant-infested flowers was greatly reduced, compared to ant-free control flowers. Similarly, for fruits with ants, very few seeds were likely to be ingested and dispersed by the geckos. Thus, T. albipes monopolizes flowers and fruits of R. simplex, and prevents access of pollinating and seed-dispersing P. cepediana geckos by aggressive interference competition.

Other research indicates that C. maculosa plants from the invasive range in North America have evolved to be larger and better competitors than conspecifics from the native range in Europe, a component of the 'evolution of increased competitive ability' hypothesis. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but this evidence sets the stage for comparing the relative importance of evolved competitive ability to inherent competitive traits. In a competition experiment with a large number of C. maculosa populations, we found no difference in the competitive effects of C. maculosa plants from North America and Europe on other species. However, both North American and European C. maculosa were much better competitors against plants native to North America than congeners native to Romania, collected in areas where C. maculosa is also native. These results are consistent with the novel weapons hypothesis. But, in a second experiment using just one population from North America and Europe, and where North American and European species were collected from a broader range of sites, competitive interactions were weaker overall, and the competitive effects of C. maculosa were slightly stronger against European species than against North American species. Also consistent with the novel weapons hypothesis, (+/-)-catechin had stronger effects on native North American species than on native European species in two experiments.

But there have been remarkably few empirical efforts to investigate the accuracy of this concept in situ. The concept of redundancy could be roughly split into two components: the ecological redundancy (similar response to environmental variations involving similar ecological processes) and the functional redundancy (similar biological trait combinations shaping similar functional processes). Both types of redundancy are tested among the 3 invasive European Elodeas. In 11 sites and during two successive years 2004-2005, the cover growth rate of each Elodea species was monthly recorded. To test ecological redundancy, cover growth rates were related to a large suite of environmental variables. To test functional redundancy, 13 biological traits involved in competitive relationships were measured each month. Firstly, the redundancy hypothesis looks problematic for Elodea ernstiae. Indeed, the later possess numerous biological traits involved in light competition and niche overlap with the other Elodeas is very low. Secondly, ecological and functional redundancy can be successfully applied to Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii. They share a large suite of biological traits leading to wide niche overlaps through the growing season. And the measured environmental variables do not differentially influence their growth rates, which are, in turn, controlled by a similar group of biological traits. In this way, the different invasiveness patterns of E. canadensis and E. nuttallii could be solely due to the ecological drift and their ecological dynamic could follow neutral rules.",Web of Science,Elodea canadensis;Elodea ernstiae; Elodea nuttallii  ,France,Alsace,Rhine former floodplain,48.5837,7.7388,Field - Observational,lotic,,Fundamentals,,,primary

We tested the hypothesis that different species assemblages of grassland communities may partly result from interactive influences between the relative invasiveness of available species and community invasibility. During 10 months, we evaluated seed and microsite limitation of seedling emergence, survival, and recruitment of plants belonging to species with different seed size (large-seeded species vs. small-seeded species), with in a two-phase community mosaic typical of semi-natural grasslands in the southern flooding Pampa of Argentina. Seeds of large versus small-seeded species were sown either in species-poor patches dominated by a tall tussock grass ('pajonal') or in species-rich patches dominated by short grasses ('matrix'), subjected to different levels of canopy disturbance (cut vs. uncut). Seed addition promoted seedling emergence for 7 out of the 10 species sown, and this effect was higher for large than for small-seeded species. After seed limitations were removed, interactive effects among seed size, community state and canopy disturbance reflected a strong positive influence of seed size on plant recruitment only in cut pajonal patches. Therefore, according to the stage of invasion process, relative species success may depend on non-interactive (seed-size effect on seed limitation to seedling emergence) or interactive influences among species invasibility and community invasiveness (from seedling emergence to plant recruitment). As a general conclusion, different assemblages of species are expected to successfully colonize spatially close grassland patches, according to both the available invasible species (seed size) and the community state and stage (species composition and canopy disturbance).",Web of Science,Many,Argentina,,southeast Pampa,-37,-58,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness;Propagule Pressure;Other,,primary

In a series of common garden experiments, we explored whether differences in the seasonality of precipitation, specifically, summer drought vs summer rain, and the amount and variation of annual and seasonal precipitation affect the germination responses of populations of an annual ruderal plant, Centaurea solstitialis, from its native range and from two non-native regions with different climates. We found that seeds from all native populations, irrespective of the precipitation seasonality of the region in which they occurred, and non-native populations from regions with dry summers displayed similarly high germination proportions and rates. In contrast, genotypes from the non-native region with predominantly summer rain exhibited much lower germination fractions and rates. Also, percent germination was strongly correlated with variation in precipitation in winter, the season that follows germination for C. solstitialis. Specifically, germination was lower for native and non-native populations experiencing greater variation in winter precipitation. This correlation, however, was greatly influenced by the non-native region with summer rain, which also exhibited the greatest variation in winter precipitation among studied regions. These results suggest that rather than general climatic patterns, the degree of risk experienced at early developmental stages could exert an important control over the germination strategy of C. solstitialis populations in both native and non-native ranges. Also, these findings reveal a largely unique germination response in C. solstitialis genotypes growing in the non-native region with summer rain and high variation in winter precipitation.

Root biomass, root length, root N uptake rate, root and leaf morphology, leaf nitrogen productivity (leaf NP) as well as biomass and N allocation were quantified over four harvests. Path analysis indicated that leaf NP was the key trait contributing to variation in N capture among the species. Species with a higher leaf NP produced more root length and consequently captured more N under a range of soil N availability. This suggests variation in leaf NP may be one critical trait determining the ability of the resident plant community to resist establishment of these invaders.

While many species respond to this heterogeneity through root system plasticity, little is known about how the magnitude of these responses may vary between native and invasive species. We quantified root morphological and physiological plasticity of co-occurring native and invasive Great Basin species in response to soil nitrogen heterogeneity and determined if trade-offs exist between these foraging responses and species relative growth rate or root system biomass. The nine study species included three perennial bunchgrasses, three perennial forbs, and three invasive perennial forbs. The plants were grown in large pots outdoors. Once a week for 4 weeks equal amounts of (NH4)-N-15 (NO3)-N-15 were distributed in the soil either evenly through the soil profile, in four patches, or in two patches. All species acquired more N in patches compared to when N was applied evenly through the soil profile. None of the species increased root length density in enriched patches compared to control patches but all species increased root N uptake rate in enriched patches. There was a positive relationship between N uptake rate, relative growth rate, and root system biomass. Path analysis indicated that these positive interrelationships among traits could provide one explanation of how invasive forbs were able to capture 2 and 15-fold more N from enriched patches compared to the native grasses and forbs, respectively. Results from this pot study suggest that plant traits related to nutrient capture in heterogeneous soil environments may be positively correlated which could potentially promote size-asymmetric competition belowground and facilitate the spread of invasive species. However, field experiments with plants in different neighbor environments ultimately are needed to determine if these positive relationships among traits influence competitive ability and invader success.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Oregon,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor;Rapid Growth,primary

A comparative study of invaders and co-occurring natives is a useful approach to gaining insights into the invasiveness of exotic plants. Spartina alterniflora, a C-4 grass, is a widespread invader in the coastal wetlands in China and other regions of the world. We conducted a comparative study of S. alterniflora and native C-3 species, Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, in terms of their gas exchange and efficiencies in resource utilization. We tested the hypothesis that S. alterniflora has growth-related ecophysiological advantages over the natives in its non-native range, which result in its rapid growth and enhance its invasiveness. Photosynthesis, leaf area index (LAI), specific leaf area (SLA), and the efficiency of resource use (light, water, and nitrogen) were examined monthly for eight months in 2004. Overall, S. alterniflora had greater LAI, higher maximal net photosynthetic rate (Amax), and longer growing season than those of the native species. On average, the efficiencies of S. alterniflora in light, water, and nitrogen utilization were respectively 10.1%, 26.1%, and 33.1% higher than those of P. australis, and respectively 70.3%, 53.5%, 28.3% higher than those of S. mariqueter. However, SLA of S. alterniflora was significantly lower than those of P. australis and S. mariqueter. Although there was no general pattern in the relationship between invasiveness and plant photosynthetic types, in this study, most of the ecophysiological characteristics that gave S. alterniflora a competitive advantage in the Yangtze River estuary were associated with photosynthetic pathways. Our results offer a greater understanding of the relationship between invasiveness and plant photosynthetic type. Our results also indicate that LAI and the length of the photosynthetic season, which vary with habitats, are also important in invasion success. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the distribution of invasive plants at landscape scale, and the factors controlling their dispersal and establishment are still poorly understood. This is the case for Rosa rugosa, an invasive shrub with negative effects on biodiversity in dune ecosystems of NW Europe. The aim of the study was to identify the factors which determine the distribution of R rugosa in coastal dunes. In a large semi-natural dune area of NW Denmark (2364 ha) all patches of the species (1321, 1.3-59.1 m(2)) were GPS mapped. Patch distribution was GIS analysed, based on aerial photographs and vegetation maps. The distance of R. rugosa from the most conspicuous landscape elements was compared with randomly placed reference points. The species had invaded 0.35% of the dune landscape, and it was present in all vegetation types and all parts of the study area. Rosa rugosa patches were slightly smaller in grey dunes than in white dunes and brown dunes, and some of the largest patches were found close to villages. The occurrence of the shrub was positively correlated with distance to the coastline, to roads, tracks and houses. We conclude that the distribution of R rugosa is determined by both natural and anthropogenic factors. It is further discussed how these factors may control dispersal and establishment of the species, and how the results can be used for improved management of coastal dunes. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Methods: On both sides of this road. presence and abundance of exotic plants was recorded in four 25-m long road-verge plots and in parallel 25 m x 2 m adjacent land plots, nested at five altitudinal levels: 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400 and 2700 in a.s.l. Exotic community structure was analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis while a two-level nested Generalized Linear Model was fitted for richness and cover of exotics. We tested the upper altitudinal limits tor all exotics along this road for spatial clustering around four potential propagule sources Using a t-test. Results: Community structure, richness and abundance of exotics were negatively correlated with altitude. Greatest invasion by exotics was recorded for adjacent land at the 1500 in level. Of the 45 exotics, 16 were found at higher altitudes than expected and observations were spatially clustered around potential propagule sources. Conclusions: Spatial clustering of upper altitudinal limits around human inhabited areas suggests that exotics originate from these areas, while exceeding expected altitudinal limits suggests that distribution ranges of exotics are presently underestimated. Excites are generally characterised by a high propagule pressure and/or persistent seedbanks, thus future tarring of the Sani Pass may result in art increase of exotic species richness and abundance.

Invasive plants have various negative effects on natives through competition; however, relatively little is known about competition for pollination. The relationship between Japanese native dandelions (Taraxacum spp.) and invasive congeners may be a typical case of such an interaction. For example, native dandelions are being replaced by invasive congeners, especially in urban and suburban areas of Japan. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesized that when natives are mixed with attractive invasives, natives may suffer from reduced seed set because invasives deprive natives of pollinators or because pollinators frequently move between species, resulting in interspecific pollen transfer. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of the invasive dandelion T. officinale on the pollination and seed set of the native T. japonicum using artificial arrays of monospecific and mixed-species plots as well as natural populations. Taraxacum officinale attracted more pollinator visits, perhaps because it produced more nectar than T. japonicum. The number of pollinator visits to T. japonicum was reduced when the congeners were grown together, and pollinators moved frequently between the two species. The proportion of seed set for T. japonicum was reduced in the presence of T. officinale in both artificial arrays and natural populations. These results support our hypothesis that interspecific competition for pollination plays an important role in the recent replacement of native dandelions by invasive congeners in Japan. Because invasive dandelions are apomicts, negative effects are incurred only by sexual natives. Thus, this system can be recognized as a rare case of interspecific interaction through pollination.",Web of Science,Taraxacum officinale,Japan,Nara Prefecture; Osaka Prefecture; Kyoto Prefecture,,,,Field - Experimental;Field - Observational,terrestrial,Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation;Inherent Superiority;Other,Effective Disperser,primary

Field observations suggest that D. villosus has replaced the native G. pulex and the invasive D. haemobaphes, also a Ponto-Caspian species, in some reaches of the German Danube. Dikerogammarus villosus is also believed to be the reason why Echinogammarus berilloni, a Mediterranean species, and Dikerogammarus bispinosus, a further Ponto-Caspian gammaridean species, could not build significant populations in Southern German rivers. Because intraguild predation (IGP) is regarded as a major force leading to species displacements, we hypothesized that superiority in predation by D. villosus is responsible for the disappearance or limited occurrence of several native and invasive gammarideans in many reaches of Southern German waters. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of laboratory IGP experiments with 1:1 combinations in which D. villosus was allowed to prey on other gammarids and vice versa. We also studied the extent of cannibalism within species. Dikerogammarus villosus was a stronger predator than G. pulex and E. berilloni. However, D. villosus was not stronger in predation than its relatives D. haemobaphes and D. bispinosus, although results with the combinations of D. villosus and D. bispinosus were less conclusive, especially in the female-female combination. Cannibalism rate was high in D. haemobaphes compared with other species. We conclude that superiority in IGP experiments could explain the disappearance of G. pulex and the missing or limited occurrence of E. berilloni since the arrival of D. villosus in Southern German rivers. However, the results of IGP experiments do not explain why D. haemobaphes was displaced by D. villosus in many places and why D. bispinosus could not build significant populations in Southern German waters.

The success of invasive ants is thought to be linked to the availability of carbohydrate-rich resources, though reports of invasive ant visits to EFNs are mixed.

Humans have played a central role in the expansion process, and it is important to incorporate such considerations into management plans. Using generalized linear models, our first aim was to describe how the invasion success of 862 prominent alien plant species on Mediterranean islands is related to characteristics of the introduction process: introduction frequency, date and region of origin, range size and purpose of import. The importance of each was measured by the numbers of species present and their average invasiveness. The main findings were: (a) accidental imports and ornamentals accounted for a high proportion of all aliens, although neither group had particularly high average invasiveness; (b) introduction frequency had a comparatively modest influence, with the most commonly-introduced species naturalized only three times more widely than those rarely-introduced; (c) rates of species introduction appear to have increased dramatically in the last century, although aliens which have been present in the region for more than 200 years were most widespread, indicating that it may be centuries before some species fill their potential range; (d) there were small tendencies for successful invaders to originate in the Neotropics or in regions with Mediterranean climate biomes and to have large range sizes. Our second aim was to determine whether the number or average invasiveness of species introduced via a given pathway had the most influence on the overall probability of invasion on a given island. An elasticity analysis suggested that the number of species was substantially the best predictor of the two. This finding arises largely because invasion events are rare and remain unpredictable, and has significant implications for assessing invasion risk. We discuss how substantial sources of error and intrinsic variability in invasiveness within species groups limit the potential for developing accurate risk models.

Dietary analysis based on the stomach contents of individuals caught in several Iberian basins was carried out as a first step to evaluate its potential threat for the native Iberian ichthyofauna. Aquatic macroinvertebrates (mainly Chironomidae) dominated the black bullhead's diet in all size-classes and sites, irrespective of natural riverine or artificial lentic habitats. Secondary prey items were responsible for the observed between-sites (microcrustaceans in artificial lentic habitat; oligochaeta and caddisfly larvae in natural riverine habitats) and ontogenetic diet differences (from microcrustaceans to larger prey). These diet variations were also detected in trophic diversity values and feeding strategy plots. Black bullheads consumed plant material, terrestrial prey and co-occurring fish species (native or exotic) and thus they could be considered as generalist or opportunistic, foraging on the most abundant and available prey. There was no positive relationship between black bullhead size (total length) and fish prey size, probably indicating piscivory on dead or dying vulnerable fishes as well as predation on smaller-sized active fishes. The results showed that the black bullhead could negatively affect native Iberian ichthyofauna throughout direct predation and competition. Aspects of potential conservation and management implications of fishes resulting from the undesirable presence of the black bullhead in Iberian water bodies are discussed.

For North America north of Mexico, we summarized jurisdiction occurrence data for seven macroinvertebrate taxa with strong influences on soil biodiversity or processes. We analysed the relationships of native and introduced species richness to each other using linear regression; to latitude using Gaussian regressions; and, using the residuals of the richness-latitude regressions, to distance from coasts, human population density, and human population size using regression and correlation. We found weak to strong positive relationships between native and introduced species richness. This variation was related to divergent relationships of native and introduced species with latitude, human population density, and distance from coasts. Native species richness declined with increasing latitude for all taxa, as did introduced species richness for taxa with predominantly lower-latitude origins (ants, termites, non-lumbricid earthworms). In contrast, introduced species richness peaked at higher latitudes for four taxa of predominantly Palearctic origins (weevils, ground beetles, lumbricid earthworms, isopods). Partitioning introduced taxa within these groups based on region of origin, we found that Palearctic taxa were distributed at higher latitudes than non-Palearctic taxa. Thus source region appears to strongly influence introduced species richness-latitude relationships. Compared to natives, introduced species exhibited more positive relationships with human population density and negative relationships with distance from coasts, but did not differ in relationships with human population size. Thus coastal, densely populated regions are likely to have a higher proportion of introduced soil macroinvertebrate species. These differences between distribution of native and introduced species tend to weaken positive correlations between native and introduced species richness, especially for taxa dominated by Palearctic introductions.",Web of Science,Many,USA; Canada,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,herbivore;omnivore;decomposer

The introduced red-whiskered bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) feeds on many fleshy-fruited species, and often moves from invaded and degraded habitats into higher quality native forests, thus potentially acting as a mediator of continued plant invasion into these areas. Furthermore, gut passage may influence seed germination. To investigate this, we fed fleshy fruits of two invasive plant species, Ligustrum robustum and Clidemia hirta, to red-whiskered bulbuls. Gut passage times of seeds were recorded. Gut-passed seeds were sown and their germination rate and germination success compared with that of hand-cleaned seeds, as well as that of seeds in whole fruits. Gut passage and hand-cleaning had significant positive effects on germination of both species. Gut-passed seeds of both C. hirta and L. robustum germinated faster than hand-cleaned seeds. However, for L. robustum, this was only true when compared with hand-cleaned seeds with intact endocarp; when compared with hand-cleaned seeds without endocarp, there was no difference. For overall germination success, there was a positive effect of gut passage for C. hirta, but not for L. robustum. For both C. hirta and L. robustum, no seeds in intact fruits geminated, suggesting that removal of pulp is essential for germination. Our results suggest that, first, the initial invasion of native forests in Mauritius may not have happened so rapidly without efficient avian seed dispersers like the red-whiskered bulbul. Second, the bulbul is likely to be a major factor in the continued re-invasion of C. hirta and L. robustum into weeded and restored conservation management areas.",Web of Science,"Pycnonotus jocosus; Ligustrum robustum, Clidemia hirta",Mauritius,,Black River Gorges National Park,-20.6333,57.75,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary;herbivore

Griseb. is one of many aggressive invasive plants that can grow in diverse habitats. Aquatic A. philoxeroides forms dense floating mats over the water surface. However, when water levels decrease during winter, some mats become stranded on exposed sediments and are thus exposed to air. Do the stems of these mats possess the capacity to develop new shoots during the next growing season? In this study, we examined the sprouting of sediment-stranded over-wintering mats of A. philoxeroides. Stems of the over-wintering mats were divided into three types (dry, withered, and fresh stems) depending on moisture content and were immersed in water for 4 weeks to observe the sprouting of axillary buds and roots. The results showed that withered stems yielded much more biomass than dry or fresh stems. Stem moisture content significantly affected the sprouting rate and the length growth rate of buds and roots. Dry stems lacked reproductive capacity. The sprouting rate and length growth rate of the buds and roots were higher in fresh stems than in withered stems. Furthermore, the mean values of the bud sprouting rate and the bud length growth rate were highest during the first week, i.e., most of buds sprouted within 1 week or less. Our results suggest that more than 70% (on a dry weight basis) of the stems in stranded mats possessed rapid sprouting capacity even after over-wintering on the sediment for more than 2 months. This strategy may be an adaptation to the fluctuations inherent in many aquatic habitats, and it possibly explains why A. philoxeroides can flourish even after a dry winter.",Web of Science,Alternanthera philoxeroides,China,Hubei,Changgang Canal,,,Field - Observational;Lab,lentic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances;Rapid Growth;Clonal Reproduction,primary

One might expect, however, that the impacts of introduced solitary bees, with much lower population densities and fewer foragers, would be small. Yet little is known about the potential effects of naturalized solitary bees on the environment. We took advantage of the recent naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, in southern Florida to study the effects of this solitary bee on reproduction of Solanum torvum, an invasive shrub. Flowers of S. torvum require specialized buzz pollination. Through timed floral visitor watches and two pollination treatments (control and pollen supplementation) at three forest edge and three open area sites, we found that the fruit set of S. torvum was pollen limited at the open sites where the native bees dominate, but was not pollen limited at the forest sites where the invasive orchid bees dominate. The orchid bee's pollination efficiency was nearly double that of the native halictid bees, and was also slightly higher than that of the native carpenter bee. Experiments using small and large mesh cages (to deny or allow E. viridissima access, respectively) at one forest site indicated that when the orchid bee was excluded, the flowers set one-quarter as many fruit as when the bee was allowed access. The orchid bee was the most important pollinator of the weed at the forest sites, which could pose additional challenges to the management of this weed in the fragmented, endangered tropical hardwood forests in the region. This specialized invasive mutualism may promote populations of both the orchid bee and this noxious weed. Invasive solitary bees, particularly species that are specialized pollinators, appear to have more importance than has previously been recognized.",Web of Science,Euglossa viridissima; Solanum torvum,United States,Florida,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary;herbivore

Across larger spatial scales, positive relationships suggest that exotic and native species respond similarly to factors other than diversity. In the case of island habitats, such factors may include island size and isolation from the mainland. However, previous island studies exploring this issue examined only a few islands or islands separated by extreme distances. In this study, we surveyed exotic and native plant diversity on 25 islands separated by <15 km in Boston Harbor. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated. Consistent with island biogeography theory, species richness of both groups was positively related to area and negatively related to isolation. However, the isolation effect was significantly stronger for native species. This differential effect of isolation on native species translated into exotic species representing a higher proportion of all plant species on more distant islands. The community similarity of inner harbor islands vs. outer harbor islands was greater for exotic species, indicating that isolation had a weaker influence on individual exotic species. These results contrast with recent work focusing on similarities between exotic and native species and highlight the importance of studies that use an island biogeographic approach to better understand those factors influencing the ecology of invasive species.",Web of Science,Many,U.S.A.,Massachusetts,Boston Harbor,42.355892,-71.050884,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland;Deciduous Forest;Wetland;Chaparral/Shrublands;Old Field;Intertidal/Near Shore,Fundamentals;Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,primary

We analyzed the vegetation associated with feral horse dung piles in montane pampas grasslands in Mid-East Argentina and described the changes following their abandonment, evaluating whether dung piles act as invasion windows, allowing the entrance of alien plant species. We estimated the portion of the study area directly covered by horse manure and dung height was used to estimate the time elapsed after the abandonment of each pile. Vegetation replacement on dung piles of different ages was assessed and compared with grassland controls using discriminant analysis. We used regression analysis to look for changes in vegetation cover, species richness, species diversity and evenness in response to height (age) of the dung piles, and principal component analyses (PCA) to identify groups of plants associated with different successional stages. We compared cover of alien plant species on dung piles with grassland controls using one-way ANOVA. On average, 2.5% of the study area was covered by horse dung. Total vegetation cover, species richness, diversity and evenness increased after the piles were abandoned. Characteristic plant groups were associated with initial, middle and last phases of the studied succession. Vegetation on the dung piles significantly differed from that in grassland controls and two species were consistently associated with dung piles: the invasive Red Star Thistle, Centaurea calcitrapa, and a native grazing-intolerant grass, Nassella clarazii. Non-native species cover was also higher in dung piles than in control plots. Dung piles cover a significant portion of grassland area in our study site, produce significant changes in the vegetation and are associated with some invasive alien plants that could eventually colonize more pristine areas in the vicinity.

Urchin density had a significant effect on survival of C. fragile. At low densities, urchin fronts were more likely to bypass the invasive alga, though urchins following behind the front eventually consumed most individuals. Urchins' preferred food, laminarian kelps, affected the survival time of C. fragile by slowing the forward propagation of the front, but did not divert urchins from consuming C. fragile. The presence of dense stands of the unpalatable macroalgae Desmarestia viridis and periods of high water temperature and wave action appeared to facilitate the survival of C. fragile by affecting urchin foraging behaviour.

The Enemy Release Hypothesis proposes that exotic species gain an advantage in new regions because their natural enemies are lost during invasion; however, enemy release could also occur as a result of much smaller scale movements within an invasive plant's native range, i.e. if it escapes enemies while colonizing new sites. Few studies have considered this possibility, and none has compared escape from multiple guilds of enemies. 2. We studied an invasive North American weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), to determine whether it escapes above-ground or below-ground enemies at a local scale in its native range. Exotic populations of this plant are known to have escaped above-ground enemies in Europe. 3. Experimental populations of ragweed isolated from existing populations by just 100 m experienced reduced levels of damage by invertebrate folivores and seed predators; however, there was no clear evidence that this escape led to improved performance. 4. Plants inoculated with unsterilized soil grew better than plants in sterile soil, likely reflecting a need for mycorrhizal colonization. Inoculum from ragweed populations was as beneficial as inoculum from nearby ragweed-free sites, suggesting only a small initial role for site-specific pathogens. 5. Performance declined over time when plants were serially inoculated with non-sterile soil, indicating negative feedback with the soil biota. This feedback was stronger for inocula derived from ragweed populations vs. those from nearby ragweed-free sites. 6. Seeds buried in ragweed populations were less likely to germinate subsequently than seeds buried in nearby ragweed-free sites. This difference was not reduced by treatment with fungicide; consequently, the mechanism is unclear. 7. Synthesis. These results indicate that ragweed can escape both above-ground and below-ground enemies by dispersing to new sites, resulting in reduced levels of folivory, seed predation, soil feedback and perhaps losses to seed pathogens. Although consequences often may be small, this demonstrates that enemy release can occur for native as well as exotic populations of this species, linking possible mechanisms of local spread with long-distance invasion.",Web of Science,Ambrosia artemisiifolia l.,Canada,Ontario, Kof&#64258;er Scienti&#64257;c Reserve at Jokers Hill,44.03,-79.29,Field - Experimental;Lab,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

One line of thinking is that highly successful plant invaders achieve dominance in recipient communities via competitive superiority over natives. In contrast, it has been proposed that exotic species attain dominance not by competitive prowess but due to their colonizing abilities after disturbance. Interestingly, there have been relatively few attempts to quantify competitive effects of invaders on natives (and vice versa) in field settings. 2. We created monocultures of ten native perennial species and after two seasons of establishment we either left assemblages uninvaded or invaded them with seeds from one of three potent exotics; spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), Dalmatian toadflax (Lineria dalmatica) and sulfur cinquefoil (Potentilla recta). Invasion was crossed with a supplemental water treatment to determine how increased resource supply might alter competitive outcomes. We also compared traits of exotics and natives to determine whether differences in height, lateral spread, shoot : root ratio and specific leaf area might shed light on competitive effects. 3. Exotics suppressed native biomass by an average of 51%. Water addition had no effect on invasibility or the competitive impact of exotics on natives. Although exotics decreased native biomass, invasion increased total above-ground biomass. Spotted knapweed was the most successful invader, and because of its greater abundance, it had the largest competitive impacts on natives. Spotted knapweed invasion also reduced plant-available soil nitrogen, water and light. 4. The majority of native species did not differ in their resistance to weed invasion, although Achillea millefolium and Festuca idahoensis monocultures were more resistant to invasion than monocultures of Antennaria rosea. Exotic biomass was either unaffected by competition with natives (knapweed) or was moderately suppressed by natives (cinquefoil and toadflax). Native species did not differ significantly in their competitive impacts on exotics and resource supply only influenced the competitive impacts of natives on spotted knapweed. Knapweed and toadflax, in particular, differed from all the natives in combined growth and leaf traits. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that exotics exert strong competitive dominance over individual native species with competitive effects relatively unaltered by increased resource supply. These effects occurred in undisturbed assemblages, suggesting that invader-native competitive outcomes can drive invasion dynamics for the species studied.",Web of Science,Centaurea maculosa; Lineria dalmatica; Potentilla recta,United States,Montana,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Grassland,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Fluctuating Resources,Superior Competitor,primary

Predicting how invasibility responds to multiple anthropogenic impacts is particularly challenging due to the variety of potential stressors and complex responses. Using manipulative field experiments, we examined the relative impact of perturbations that primarily change abiotic or biotic factors to promote invasion in coastal salt marsh plant communities. Specifically we test the hypotheses that nitrogen enrichment and human trampling facilitate invasion of upland weeds into salt marsh, and that the ability of salt marsh communities to resist and/or recover from invasion is modified by hydrological conditions. Nitrogen enrichment affected invasion of non-native upland plants at only one of six sites, and increased aboveground native marsh biomass at only two sites. Percent cover of native marsh plants declined with trampling at all sites, but recovered earlier at tidally flushed sites than at tidally restricted sites. Synergistic interactions between trampling and restricting tidal flow resulted in significantly higher cover of non-native upland plants in trampled plots at tidally restricted sites. Percent cover of non-native plants recovered to pre-trampling levels in fully tidal sites, but remained higher in tidally restricted sites after 22 months. Thus, perturbations that reduce biotic resistance interact with perturbations that alter abiotic conditions to promote invasion.

We studied populations of Rhamnus cathartica L.

Surveys and neighborhood functions were used to examine demography and spatial distribution. Populations of R. cathartica in maple-beech forests were sparse (112 ha(-1)), dominated by seedlings and saplings, and strongly aggregated in space. Populations of R cathartica in plantations, by contrast, were dense (7,717 ha(-1)), not strongly concentrated at the low end of the diameter distribution, and less strongly aggregated than those in other habitats. Old fields included a high density of R. cathartica plants (5,912 ha(-1)), which were predominantly seedlings and strongly aggregated. Seedling density was positively related to availability of light at our forested plots, and plants were clustered near walking trails at three of four maple-beech plots. At all old field and two of four plantations, seedlings were spatially associated with fruiting R. cathartica, suggesting that they served as recruitment foci. Further, seedlings also were associated with non-fruiting adult R cathartica at 2 of 3 old-field and 2 of 4 plantation plots.

Few studies have evaluated the influence of both environmental factors and disturbance history on invasive species distributions, or assessed synthetically the importance of landscape-level disturbances like historical land-use, forest harvesting, and contemporary forest fragmentation. We analyzed vegetation, soils, and recent and historical land-use and landscape context for forests across central and western Massachusetts to identify controls on invasive species distributions. Almost half (49.3%) of 148 randomly selected sites had at least one non-native invasive plant present, and invasive species occurred more frequently on former agricultural sites than in continuous woodlands. We used logistic regression to model the probability of finding the four most common species: Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC), glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula L.), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb. ex Murr.), and oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculata Thunb.). Soil richness was the most important predictor of invasive presence, with rich soils (i.e., lower C:N) being more likely to have these species. The structure of the current forested landscape (i.e., the amount of forest within a 10 km buffer around a site) is also important, with sites that are surrounded by more forest being less likely to have invasives. After accounting for variation in C:N ratios and the structure of the current forested landscape, historical land-use was not a significant predictor of non-native species occurrence; however, C:N ratios may be influenced by historical land-use and by current vegetation, thus complicating interpretations of this edaphic variable.

We explored the potential for interactions between these co-occurring invasions through a gypsy moth feeding trial using the following three highly invasive, exotic shrubs: honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), privet (Ligustrum sinense) and burning bush (Euonymus alatus). We compared these with two native shrubs: spicebush (Lindera benzoin) and pawpaw (Asimina triloba). We fed gypsy moth caterpillars foliage exclusively from one of the five shrubs and measured their relative consumptive rate (RCR), relative growth rate (RGR), and development time (DT). The RCR of gypsy moth was strongly influenced by the species of foliage (F = 31.9; P < 0.0001) with little or no consumption of honeysuckle and privet. Caterpillar RGR was influenced by the shrub species (F = 66.2; P < 0.0001), and those caterpillars fed spicebush, honeysuckle or privet lost weight over the course of the assay.

A significant negative correlation was observed between A. gracilipes and hermit crab abundance. On islands with A. gracilipes, crabs were generally restricted to the periphery of invaded islands. Very few hermit crabs were found in central areas of these islands where A. gracilipes abundances were highest. Ant exclusion experiments demonstrated that changes in the abundance and distribution of hermit crabs on Tokelau are a result of competition. The ants did not kill the hermit crabs. Rather, when highly abundant, A. gracilipes attacked crabs by spraying acid and drove crabs away from carrion resources. Analysis of naturally occurring N and C isotopes suggests that the ants are effectively lowering the trophic level of crabs. According to delta(15) N values, hermit crabs have a relatively high trophic level on islands where A. gracilipes have not invaded. In contrast, where these ants have invaded we observed a significant decrease in delta(15) N for all crab species. This result concurs with our experiment in suggesting long-term exclusion from carrion resources, driving co-occurring crabs towards a more herbivorous diet. Changes in hermit crab abundance or distribution may have major ramifications for the stability of plant communities. Because A. gracilipes have invaded many tropical islands where the predominant scavengers are hermit crabs, we consider that their competitive effects are likely to be more prominent in structuring communities than predation.",Web of Science,Anoplolepis gracilipes,New Zealand,Tokelau,Nukunonu atoll,-9.75,-171.58333,Field - Experimental;Field - Observational,,Intertidal/Near Shore,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,omnivore;predator;decomposer

However, a general understanding of consistent and predictable impacts of non-native species on native freshwater diversity is limited, in part, because of a lack of broad-scale studies including data from numerous localities across multiple drainages. This study uses data from 751 localities collected during the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program to examine the influence of non-native fish species on native freshwater fish assemblages across the United States. In general, no significant differences in native fish richness and diversity measures were detected between sites with only native species and sites containing non-native species. However, at sites with non-native species, the number of non-native species present was negatively correlated with native species richness and Shannon diversity and positively correlated with native evenness. Non-native piscivores were negatively correlated with native species richness and Shannon diversity and positively correlated with native evenness. Native piscivores were positively correlated with native richness and diversity and negatively correlated with native evenness at sites with only native species. Our results suggest that from a superficial perspective, native species richness and diversity are not different among sites with and without non-native species. However, when patterns of native species richness and diversity are examined at sites containing non-native species, correlations between non-native and native species richness and diversity imply the expected negative effect of invasive taxa. Additionally, non-native piscivores appear to have a significant negative effect on native taxa and possibly represent a novel selective force on naive native prey.",Web of Science,Many,United States,,United States,,,Field - Observational,lotic,,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,omnivore

However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called 'magnet-species'). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an 'invasional meltdown'.

One hundred achenes from two Belgian populations underwent a drop time in still air experiment in order to assess linear correlation between several morphological traits and terminal velocity. Variation in morphological traits was measured for 250 additional achenes per population. The trait best correlated to terminal velocity was the square root of the plume loading. We then used this trait to model terminal velocity using a linear regression (r(2) of 79.7%). With this regression and imposing ecological parameters such as wind speed, turbulences and height of release to be representative of favourable dispersal conditions, we established a Gaussian tilted plume model to predict the seed rain pattern of the species.

Simulations showed that a combination of direct and density-dependent effects of overfishing, eutrophication-induced nutrient enrichment, climate-induced over-enrichment and temperature-controlled Mnemiopsis spring production were involved in the shift. Eutrophication made the system vulnerable to further enrichment through the change of regional climate to a severe winter regime during 1985-87. While Mnemiopsis was acclimating to its new environment, increasing nitrate flux into the euphotic layer enhanced the carrying capacity of the system, but a disproportionate Mnemiopsis biomass increase was delayed until spring temperature conditions returned to normal in 1988-89. Enhanced carrying capacity provided a competitive advantage of food consumption to Mnemiopsis compared with anchovy, and warm spring temperature conditions promoted their spring-summer production. Prevalent high fishery pressure and increasing impact of Mnemiopsis on the food web further induced the anchovy stock collapse. However, the shift event did not result in alternation of the system to a new totally Mnemiopsis-invaded quasi-stable regime. Instead, anchovy started recovering when the subsequent strong 1991-93 cooling regime limited the Mnemiopsis population growth. Our analysis indicated that the switch of a large marine ecosystem to a totally gelatinous invader-dominated state requires extremely strong environmental perturbations. More often, environmental disturbances create a suitable niche for an alien gelatinous invader to become a member of the food web structure, and to share food resources with the native small pelagic fish community.",Web of Science,Mnemiopsis leidyi,,,Black Sea,,,Theoretical/Modeling,marine,Pelagic/Open Ocean,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Empty Niche,Superior Competitor,filter

Invasive ants commonly reach abnormally high abundances and have severe impacts on the ecosystems they invade. Current invasion theory recognises that not only negative interactions, such as natural enemy release, but positive interactions, such as facilitation, are important in causing this increased abundance. 2. For invasive ants, facilitation can occur through mutualism with exudate-producing plants and insects. To obtain such partnerships, however, invaders must first displace native ants, whose communities are highly structured around such resources. 3. By manipulating the abundance of an invasive ant relative to a native, we show that a minimum threshold abundance exists for invasive ants to monopolise exudate-producing resources. In addition, we show that behavioural dominance is context dependent and varies with spatial location and numerical abundance. 4. Thus, we suggest a 'facilitation-threshold' hypothesis of ant invasion, whereby a minimum abundance of invasive ants is required before facilitation and behavioural dominance can drive abundance rapidly upwards through positive feedback.",Web of Science,Technomyrmex albipes,United Kingdom,Cornwall,"e Tropical Biome of the Eden Project, Cornwall",,,Lab,,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Propagule Pressure,Superior Competitor,herbivore

We determined whether clonal growth, characteristic of the majority of successful invaders of natural areas, facilitates the proliferation of Bromus inermis (smooth brome), an exotic grass invading prairie ecosystems across the Great Plains. By manipulating the below-ground connections of proliferating rhizomes as well as the levels of soil nitrogen along the margins of clones invading northern fescue prairies in Manitoba, Canada, we hypothesized that physiological integration would most benefit ramets invading low resource environments. Severing clonal connections reduced the mass of smooth brome shoots invading native prairies and was exacerbated by the immobilization of soil nutrients with glucose. Clonal connections were equally important in the maintenance of smooth brome density and the horizontal proliferation of ramets. Our results demonstrate the role of physiological integration in the proliferation of a clonal exotic invader and may help explain the success of clonal invaders in other regions.

Pinus contorta is considered one of the most aggressively invasive plantation species. In this paper we aim to: (a) determine patterns of P. contorta invasion in relation to its size and age structure and spatial distribution and (b) determine the effect of vegetation cover on its regeneration. For this purpose, we have chosen the Malalcahuello National Reserve in south-central Chile, which is dominated by Araucaria araucana forests. In the three A contorta trial plots, attributes were measured in order to describe its current structure. We selected one of the three P. contorta trial plots and set eight 50 m wide and 125 m centrifugal transects starting at the North Azimuth (0 degrees) orientation and then one each 45 degrees. In each transect 25 circular plots of 2.5 m radius were established every 25 m. In each plot, we measured collar diameter (CD) for each P. contorta individual and adjusted a diameter-age function. We recorded the presence of cones for each individual P. contorta within the plots and the total number of P. contorta individuals. In each plot, we measured percent vegetation cover (grass, understory and canopy). The selected parent stand showed a decrease in density from the original plantation spacing, from 2500 to 150 plants ha(-1). Of all sampled individuals, only a 38% had cones. We found reproductive structures in trees as young as 5-year-old. Regeneration was found in all transects. Mean density for the area was 1600 plants ha-1, and the greater plant number was found in the West transect, reaching an average of 6600 plants ha(-1). Through the interpolation performed with the kriging method, a map of the area with the spatial gradient of plant density was obtained. Naturally regenerated individuals of A contorta occupied an area of 78 ha where the most distant individual is located in the southeast direction at an average distance of 1200 m from the three study plots. We determined that a positive association exists between P. contorta and the species A. araucana and Nothofagus antarctica. The capacity for early and consistent reproduction and the establishment of individuals dispersed at great distances from the original plots allow us to conclude that P. contorta has great potential as an invasive species in forests of this area of the Andes of southern South America. Invasion of P. contorta has many important implications for the conservation of native forests in our region including diminished regeneration of A. araucana. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Even if seed availability is not limited, the distribution of alien plants along such a gradient might still be restricted by their ability to germinate and establish as seedlings. In the present study, we aim at testing what factors promote or limit plant invasions during early establishment by using altitude as a model gradient. Altitudinal gradients in the Wallowa Mountains (Oregon, USA) and the Swiss Alps (Valais, Switzerland). In transplant experiments along altitudinal gradients, we investigated the early establishment success of eight invasive alien Asteraceae species in their native and introduced ranges in the Wallowa Mountains and the Swiss Alps. Seedling recruitment was not restricted to relatively lower altitudes in the introduced range. In addition, we found no evidence for genetic adaptation along the altitudinal gradient in the introduced range, highlighting the importance of phenotypic flexibility for invasions. Furthermore, seedling recruitment was only enhanced by disturbance in the native range where vegetation was comparably dense but not in the introduced range. However, plant development was strongly delayed in the introduced range, probably due to low seasonal water availability. We conclude that introduced plants, due to their ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, are not necessarily more restricted in their altitudinal limits than they are in their native range.

Allelopathy has been argued as one of the mechanisms by which such exotics may become successful invaders. Three approaches have been used to examine allelopathy as a mechanism for invasion. The traditional approach examines exotic invasives in the same way that other native plants also suspected of allelopathic activities are studied. In this approach dose, fate, and replenishment of chemicals can provide powerful evidence for allelopathic processes. The bio-geographical approach often does not provide as much mechanistic evidence for allelopathy, but comparing the allelopathic effects of exotic invasives on species from their native and invaded communities yields stronger evidence than the traditional approach for whether or not allelopathy actually contributes to invasive success. The congeneric, or phylogenetic, approach involves comparative studies of exotic species with natives in the same genus or that are as closely related as possible. Congeneric approaches are limited in inference and have been used to study the role of natural enemies in exotic invasion, but this approach has not been widely used to study allelopathy and invasion.

The pikeperch is a predatory fish widely introduced in Europe and has at times been considered as an invasive species. However, little is known about the genetics of both native and introduced populations. In the present study, we surveyed an introduced pikeperch population from the Rhone River delta, a habitat that has been highly modified for agricultural purposes. Using six microsatellites, we genotyped 93 individuals distributed among four hydraulically connected water bodies: the Rhone River, an irrigation canal, a drainage canal and a brackish lagoon. Population isolation were revealed by significant genetic distances and bottleneck highlighted by population monitoring. However, values of allelic richness and unbiased expected heterozygosity observed in these populations were similar, or even higher, compare to 18 native populations from the Baltic Sea drainage. It may be explained by multiple introductions in the Rhonee drainage but also by demographic strategy that would have facilitated population persistence in this fragmented habitat. Similarly, heterozygote deficits (revealed by F-IS values) have been detected, but were also found in native populations suggesting that mating among relatives could also result from a mating behavior of the species, maybe reinforce here by the reduced carrying capacity of the artificial canals and their respective isolation. Despite harsh environmental conditions and suspected inbreeding, the pikeperch has successfully maintained viable populations in the Rhone delta. Our study suggests that one of the factors in this invasive success, apart from its ecology, could be the maintenance of a good level of genetic diversity in introduced pikeperch populations.

Alien species often face novel challenges to their spread and population growth. One critical hurdle often involves an organism's ability to tolerate environmental extremes characteristic of their invaded range. Although abiotic factors often determine range limits, there is less evidence for local adaptation in invasive organisms whose initial arrival and rapid population growth is separated by a lengthy lag period. 2. The invasive elongate hemlock scale Fiorinia externa feeds on Eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, on the east coast of North America. Following its 1908 arrival, it remained localised until entering a period of rapid northward range expansion in the 1970s. 3.

This experiment was repeated on F. externa offspring that had been reared in a common-garden environment in order to control for parental effects. 5. Northern populations were more tolerant of exposure to cold temperatures than were southern populations. This held true in both the source-population experiment and common-garden experiment. The common-garden experiment demonstrates that this difference has a genetic basis and may be the consequence of local adaptation to lower winter temperatures. 6.

Invasive plants rarely escape herbivory entirely, and for hoary cress [Lepidium draba L.

We assessed the role of increased generalist herbivory on hoary cress using representatives of four important herbivore niches commonly found in the introduced range. We experimentally examined the density dependent impact of these herbivores individually and in combination on hoary cress in a series of greenhouse experiments. We found that defoliation of the oligophagous diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lep., Plutellidae) had the strongest and most consistent impact, while damage by the stem-mining weevil Ceutorhynchus americanus Buchanan (Col., Curculionidae) tended to have the highest per capita effect. Plant response to feeding by the oligophagous crucifer flea beetle Phyllotreta cruciferae (Goeze) (Col., Chrysomelidae) was minor despite obvious feeding damage, and the impact of the polyphagous tarnished plant bug Lygus hesperus Knight (Het., Miridae) was negligible. In multiple-species experiments, herbivore impacts were usually additive. In general, we found that hoary cress can tolerate high densities of oligophagous insect herbivory and effectively resisted attack by the polyphagous L. hesperus, but also the oligophagous C. americanus. Our results indicate that a combination of plant resistance and tolerance allows hoary cress to withstand increased generalist herbivore load in its introduced range, consistent with the predictions of the ERH.",Web of Science,Lepidium draba ,USA,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Grassland;Deciduous Forest;Urban;Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

Furthermore, there is little consensus as to whether a plastic response is related to invasiveness in stressful environments. Exotic species have recently been reported in the high Andes of central Chile, where individuals have to cope with drought and poor soils, in addition to extreme temperatures. We explored if the exotic species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) has plastic responses to soil moisture and nutrient availability, and whether two sets of alpine populations derived from native and introduced populations can converge to similar plastic responses to environmental constraints. Using a common garden approach, we compared plants grown from seeds collected in alpine populations of its native range (Alps, France) and in alpine populations of its introduced range (Andes, Chile) under a drought experiment, a potassium gradient, and a nitrogen gradient. Plasticity was only found as a response to drought. Moreover, different responses were found between both origins. Andean individuals are drought-resistant, while individuals from the Alps were drought-sensitive. According to the nutrient experiments, Andean dandelions behave as a nitrogen demanding-potassium avoiding species, whereas individuals from the Alps did not show any particular dependency or repulsion tendency to either of these two nutrients. Results suggest that differences in life history traits of both derived sets of populations may have an important role in determining the response of dandelions under the evaluated conditions.

In this context, we compared growth, reproduction, competitive effect, competitive response, and defense capabilities between invasive North American populations of Centaurea maculosa and populations in Europe, where the species is native. We found that Centaurea from North America were larger than plants from European populations. North American Centaurea also demonstrated stronger competitive effects and responses than European Centaurea. However, competitive superiority did not come at a cost to herbivore defense. North American plants were much better defended against generalist insect herbivores and slightly better defended against specialists. North Americans showed a stronger inhibitory effect on the consumers ( resistance) and a better ability to regrow after attack by herbivores ( tolerance). Better defense by North Americans corresponded with higher constitutive levels of a biochemical defense compound precursor, tougher leaves, and more leaf trichomes than Europeans. North American F1 progeny of. eld collected lines retained the traits of larger size and greater leaf toughness suggesting that genetic differences, rather than maternal effects, may be the cause of intercontinental differences, but these sample sizes were small.

Genetic techniques provide basic understanding of the invasion processes. The ascidian Microcosmus squamiger is considered to be native to Australia, having been spread worldwide via transoceanic vessels. It has successfully invaded artificial and natural habitats where it has become a pest. We studied phylogeography and genetic structure of 12 M. squamiger populations, including samples from its native range (Australia) and introduced populations from the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. We amplified 574 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene in 258 individuals and found a total of 52 haplotypes. A haplotype tree revealed two main groups of haplotypes. The relative frequency of each group of haplotypes, multidimensional scaling, and analysis of molecular variance showed important differences between the western Australia localities and the remaining ones (eastern Australia and introduced populations). Furthermore, we found that the colonization of the different areas by M. squamiger has not occurred independently, as many introduced populations shared some low frequency alleles. A nested clade analysis showed a global pattern of restricted gene flow with isolation by distance, although we found episodes of long-distance dispersal in some clades. A contiguous range expansion was detected between Australian populations. We conclude that M. squamiger is native to Australia and has most likely expanded its range of distribution sequentially through worldwide shipping, especially from the harbours of the more populated eastern Australia. In introduced populations, we found a high genetic diversity which suggests enhanced invasive potential.

During 2003-2004, we used field surveys to characterize the natural spatial distribution of Schismus in relation to native shrubs, and experimentally manipulated seed rain of Ambrosia and Schismus at three distances from adult Ambrosia canopies. We measured percentage germination and individual performance of both species. Field data were complemented by a greenhouse experiment that measured competition between Ambrosia seedlings and Schismus planted at three densities and five relative abundances under controlled conditions. Field surveys showed that the density of Schismus is independent of Ambrosia shrubs, but growth is enhanced near shrub canopies. In our field experiment Schismus is facilitated by adult Ambrosia. Under controlled conditions, Schismus does not respond to the density of Ambrosia seedlings, but changes in density of Schismus decreased performance of Ambrosia seedlings. Schismus invasion may be detrimental to native perennial plant populations.

A number of experimental studies have supported the hypothesis that diversity increases invasion resistance, but several mechanisms were proposed to explain this relationship. We studied spontaneous invasion in experimental grasslands varying in species richness (1-16 (60)) and plant functional group richness and identity (1-4; grasses, legumes, tall herbs small herbs) during the first 3 years after establishment on large-area plots of 20 x 20 m size. 2. Invader species number, biomass and density decreased with increasing community species richness. The identity of successful invaders changed through time as the relative importance of external invaders (= species not belonging to the experimental species pool) decreased, while internal invaders (= species belonging to the experimental species pool) became more important. The presence of legumes increased, while the presence of grasses in the plant communities decreased density, biomass and species number of external invaders and biomass of internal invaders in the second and third year after establishment. 3. Analyses of viable seeds in the topsoil, a higher invasion in communities with more potential invaders in adjacent plots and an edge effect with a higher invader density and species number at the margin of the plots suggested recruitment limitation of internal invader species in contrast to external invader species that were more strongly limited by community characteristics. 4. Resource availability, in particular percentage cover of resident species, root length density and soil nitrate, and propagule availability had significant effects on invasibility. However, statistical analyses revealed that these variables did not completely control for effects of community species richness and the presence of grasses and legumes respectively on invasion resistance. 5. Separate analyses of frequent invader species showed that the invasion success of individual species varied in response to biodiversity and resource niches. 6. Synthesis. Our results confirm that a more complete use of available resources in plant communities of increasing species richness generally decreases invasibility. However, the overall positive effects of biodiversity on invasion resistance are dependent on species identity of the invader species.

This has frequently been attributed to evolutionary changes resulting either from founder effects, or from natural selection owing to enemy release. Another mechanism contributing to evolutionary change has largely been neglected in the past: Many invasive plant species do actually descend from cultivated plants and were therefore subject to breeding, including hybridization and artificial selection. In a common garden experiment, we compared invasive Central European populations of the ornamental shrub, Mahonia, with native populations of its putative parental species, Mahonia aquifolium and M. repens, from North America. We hypothesized that plants of invasive populations show increased growth and retained high levels of heritable variation in phenotypic traits. Indeed, invasive Mahonia plants grew larger in terms of stem length, number of leaves and above-ground biomass than either of the two native species, which did not differ significantly from each other. Since there are no hints on release of invasive Mahonia populations from natural enemies, it is likely that hybridization and subsequent selection by breeders have lead to an evolutionary increase of plant vigour in the introduced range. Further on, heritable variation was not consistently reduced in invasive populations compared with populations of the two native species. We suggest that interspecific hybridization among the Mahonia species has counteracted the harmful effects of genetic bottlenecks often associated with species introductions. Based on this case study, we conclude that, more attention has to be paid on the role of plant breeding when assessing the mechanisms behind successful plant invasions in future.",Web of Science,Mahonia aquifolium ,Germany,Bad Lauchstädt,,51.37,11.83,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,primary

Adaptive evolution in invasive plants has been shown to occur at large spatial scales to different climatic regions, but local adaptation at a smaller scale, e.g. to different habitats within a region, has rarely been studied. Therefore, we performed a case study on invasive Mahonia populations to investigate whether local adaptation may have contributed to their spread. We hypothesized that the invasion success of these populations is promoted by adaptive differentiation in response to local environmental conditions, in particular to the different soils in these habitats. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a reciprocal transplantation experiment in the field using seedlings from five Mahonia populations in Germany that are representative for the range of habitats invaded, and a greenhouse experiment that specifically compared the responses to the different soils of these habitats. We found no evidence for local adaptation of invasive Mahonia populations because seedlings from all populations responded similarly to different habitats and soils. In a second greenhouse experiment we examined genetic variation within populations, but seedlings from different maternal families did not vary in their responses to soil conditions. We therefore suggest that local adaptation of seedlings does not play a major role for the invasion success of Mahonia populations and that phenotypic plasticity, instead, could be an important trait in this stage of the life cycle.",Web of Science,Mahonia aquifolium; Mahonia repens,Germany,Bad Lauchstädt,,51.37,11.83,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary

We use data from diverse genetic markers surveyed in the source population and the USA to estimate the number of founders of this introduced population. Data from different classes of nuclear markers (microsatellites, allozymes, sex-determination locus) and mitochondrial DNA are largely congruent in suggesting that 9-20 unrelated mated queens comprised the initial founder group to colonize the USA at Mobile, Alabama. Estimates of founder group size based on expanded samples from throughout the southern USA were marginally higher than this, consistent with the hypothesis of one or more secondary introductions of the ant into the USA.

The introduced weed Oxalis pes-caprae, a significant pest of cultivation in many Mediterranean-type ecosystems, presents a suitable case study. The species distribution in the Mediterranean Basin closely follows that of olive Cultivation, limited to below 600 m; yet its potential to colonise Vulnerable areas at higher elevations has yet to be adequately assessed. To investigate the possibility, plant performance was assessed by experimentally sowing O. pes-caprae bulbils along an altitudinal gradient in the Lefka Ori mountains, Crete. The survivorship and bulbil biomass of the resulting plants all declined significantly with elevation, irrespective of soil type, initial bulbil size or seasonal variation. Whilst plants survived vegetatively up to 1400 in, seasonal bulbil productivity, likely to be critical to population viability, exceeded that of the sown bulbil biomass only below 750 in. These data indicate that the current elevation of O. pes-caprae is close to, but not at, its current climatic limit, and that low propagule pressure and scarcity of suitable habitat probably also act to limit the altitudinal distribution. Plant performance was correlated strongly with the duration of spring snow cover. Despite a 2 degrees C difference in mean spring temperatures in the 2 years of study, the predicted elevational change was only 37 m higher in the milder conditions. Overall, our results suggest that while O. pes-caprae performance is strongly linked to climate and is Currently close to its climatic limit on Crete, there is limited scope for further spread unless land use and/or propagule pressure change at higher elevations. For this species, these elements are likely to be more significant drivers of invasion risk than the predicted changes of future climates. (C) 2008 Rubell Foundation, ETH Zurich.

We were interested in whether native or invasive species are more drought-tolerant, and therefore conducted a garden (pot) experiment comparing the growth of seedlings of five native and five invasive tree species under different light (7% and 60% transmittance) and water (natural and repeated drought stress) conditions. Differences in the responses of native and invasive species to these treatments were small. In both groups, mean relative growth rates were reduced only slightly by intermittent drought that caused wilting of leaves. However, invasive species produced clearly thinner leaves (high specific leaf area, SLA) and more root biomass than native species under high light, while these differences were small under low light. Native species performed better than invasive species under low light with low water availability. It appears that high phenotypic plasticity allows some fast-growing invasive species to cope with water stress by adjusting the relative allocation of resources to aboveground and belowground structures under high light, while this strategy is not effective when both light and water resources are limiting.

Given evidence for indirect interactions and shifts in plant communities from the few existing long-term studies, it is clear that long-term studies are a critical component for understanding the role of consumers in plant invasions. Moreover, studies of the role of consumers in mediating invasions have focused on the effects of exotic consumers, while the effects of native consumers on invasion have received little attention. Here we examine the long-term impact of a largely native vertebrate consumer community on native and exotic understory plants and recruitment of native oaks in a California oak savanna. We sampled plant community composition, oak recruitment, and soils inside and outside of 10 exclosures (mean area 1000 m(2)) that had been in place for an average of 32 years. Plots with consumers present had 41% more exotic species, 31% higher cover of exotic species, and 33% lower richness of native herbaceous perennials, suggesting that native consumers may play an important role in mediating invasion in this system. The presence of oak canopies had a strong impact on the plant community independent of consumer effects, with greater recruitment of oaks, higher cover of native shrubs, and lower cover of exotic species cover under oak canopies. The concordant variation of native tree canopy and native woody plants suggests that adult oaks provide a refuge for their seedlings and other native woody plants.

Understanding plant tolerance to herbivory under different environmental conditions will help to improve biocontrol efficacy. The invasive alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) has been successfully controlled by natural enemies in many aquatic habitats but not in terrestrial environments worldwide. This study examined the effects of different levels of simulated leaf herbivory on the growth of alligator weed at two levels of fertilization and three levels of soil moisture (aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats). Increasing levels of simulated (manual) defoliation generally caused decreases in total biomass in all habitats. However, the plant appeared to respond differently to high levels of herbivory in the three habitats. Terrestrial plants showed the highest below-above ground mass ratio (R/S), indicating the plant is more tolerant to herbivory in terrestrial habitats than in aquatic habitats. The unfertilized treatment exhibited greater tolerance than the fertilized treatment in the terrestrial habitat at the first stage of this experiment (day 15), but fertilizer appears not to have influenced tolerance at the middle and last stages of the experiment. No such difference was found in semi-aquatic and aquatic habitats. These findings suggest that plant tolerance is affected by habitats and soil nutrients and this relationship could influence the biological control outcome. Plant compensatory response to herbivory under different environmental conditions should, therefore, be carefully considered when planning to use biological control in management programs against invasive plants.

Such an analysis will not only provide insights into the traits related to invasiveness, but also the habitat characteristics that underpin vulnerability to invasion that, taken together, will facilitate the selection of management strategies to mitigate the invader's effect. In the present study, we considered the Mediterranean basin islands as an excellent study region to test how the same invasive species perform in different habitats within a single island, and to scale up differences among islands with similar climate. We tested how the performance of three widespread plant invaders with clonal growth but contrasting life-history traits, a deciduous tree Ailanthus altissima, a succulent subshrub Carpobrotus spp., and an annual geophyte Oxalis pes-caprae, varied depending upon the species identity, habitat, and invaded island. The environmental parameters considered were habitat type, elevation, species diversity in the invaded plot, and several soil traits (% C, % N, C/N, pH, and relative humidity). The study documents that the performance of these three important and widespread plant invaders is dependent mainly on species identity, and less upon the invaded island's general features. Likewise, differences in performance among habitats were only significant in the case of Ailanthus, whereas Carpobrotus and Oxalis appear to perform equally well in different environments. Ailanthus thus appears to have a broader spectrum of invasiveness, being able to invade a larger number of habitat types. On the contrary, Carpobrotus spp. have not yet invaded habitats different from those where the species have been originally introduced and where they are still commonly spread by humans. Oxalis distribution is mainly related to agricultural activities and disturbed sites, and the total area infested by this geophyte may be more reflection of the extent of suitable habitats than of invasiveness or ecological impact.

We tested this hypothesis with Centaurea maculosa Lam., a species native to Europe and introduced into North America approximately 120 years ago where it became highly invasive. We analyzed the ploidy level of more than 2000 plants from 93 native and 48 invasive C. maculosa populations and found a pronounced shift in the relative frequency of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes. In Europe diploid populations occur in higher frequencies than tetraploids and only four populations had both cytotypes, while in North America diploid plants were found in only one mixed population and thus tetraploids clearly dominated. Our results showed a pronounced shift in the climatic niche between tetraploid populations in the native and introduced range toward drier climate in North America and a similar albeit smaller shift between diploids and tetraploids in the native range. The field data indicate that diploids have a predominately monocarpic life cycle, while tetraploids are often polycarpic. Additionally, the polycarpic life-form seems to be more prevalent among tetraploids in the introduced range than among tetraploids in the native range. Our study suggests that both ploidy types of C. maculosa were introduced into North America, but tetraploids became the dominant cytotype with invasion. We suggest that the invasive success of C. maculosa is partly due to preadaptation of the tetraploid cytotype in Europe to drier climate and possibly further adaptation to these conditions in the introduced range. The potential for earlier and longer seed production associated with the polycarpic life cycle constitutes an additional factor that may have led to the dominance of tetraploids over diploids in the introduced range.",Web of Science,Centaurea stoebe,,,,,,Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General;Preadaptation to Climate;Other,,primary

This dominance is often thought to be a result of release from specialist enemies in the invaded range, or the evolution of increased competitive ability. Soil borne microorganisms have often been overlooked as enemies in this context, but a less deleterious plant soil interaction in the invaded range could explain local dominance. Two plant species, Carpobrotus edulis and the hybrid Carpobrotus X cf. acinaciformis, are considered major pests in the Mediterranean basin. We tested if release from soil-borne enemies and/or evolution of increased competitive ability could explain this dominance. Comparing biomass production in non-sterile soil with that in sterilized soil, we found that inoculation with rhizosphere soil from the native range reduced biomass production by 32% while inoculation with rhizosphere soil from the invaded range did not have a significant effect on plant biomass. Genotypes from the invaded range, including a hybrid, did not perform better than plants from the native range in sterile soil. Hence evolution of increased competitive ability and hybridization do not seem to play a major role. We conclude that the reduced negative net impact of the soil community in the invaded range may contribute to the success of Carpobrotus species in the Mediterranean basin. (C) 2008 SAAB.

Visitor guild, visitation rate, and seed set were compared over 3 years in three sites in Belgium. Floral display (capitula number and arrangement) and phenology were quantified, and visiting insects were individually censused, i.e. number of visited capitula and time per visited capitulum. As expected from capitula resemblance, visitor guilds of both species were very similar (proportional similarity = 0.94). Senecio inaequidens was visited by 33 species, versus 36 for S. jacobaea. For both species, main visitors were Diptera, especially Syrphidae, and Hymenoptera. Visitation rate averaged 0.13 visitor per capitulum per 10 min for S. inaequidens against 0.08 for S. jacobaea. However, insects visited more capitula per plant on S. jacobaea, due to high capitula density (886 m(-2) versus 206 m (2) for S. inaequidens), which is likely to increase self-pollen deposition considerably. Seed set of S. jacobaea was lower than that of S. inacquidens.

Herbivores suppressed growth of invasive algae in their native (Caribbean) and invaded range (Hawaii), but despite similar levels of herbivore biomass, the intensity of herbivory was lower in Hawaii. Algal species with a circumtropical distribution did not show a similar effect of herbivores on their growth. Nutrient enrichment did not enhance growth of any algal species in either region. The reduction in herbivore intensity experienced by invasive algae in Hawaii rather than an escape from (native) herbivores provided invasive macroalgae with 'enemy release' sensu the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH). Since native, Hawaiian herbivores still feed and even prefer invasive algae over native species, invasion scenario's that involve predation (e.g. the ERH) could be falsely dismissed when invasive species are only studied in their invasive range.

Yet there is little experimental work on how ecosystem resistance to invasion at the establishment phase differs among ecosystems. We conducted two field sowing experiments in two consecutive years to examine establishment of the deciduous tree Ailanthus altissima, the succulent subshrub Carpobrotus spp. and the annual geophyte Oxalis pes-caprae in coastal dunes, shrublands and oldfields in more than 200 sites across six Mediterranean Basin islands differing in climatic conditions and local species richness. Establishment success (i.e. percentage of plots with at least one seedling) and rates (i.e. seedling to sown seed ratio) were low, especially for Ailanthus even when accounting for differences in seed viability. Oxalis was capable of producing a new cohort of seedlings the year following planting. By contrast, all Ailanthus seedlings and half the Carpobrotus seedlings died following the first summer. Differences in establishment success and rates among ecosystems were species-, island- and year-dependent. Differences in precipitation and mean temperature were associated with differences in establishment rates across sites. Establishment rates tended to be positively correlated with cumulative precipitation and negatively with mean T-a. Unexpectedly, native species richness was not a good predictor of seedling establishment, except for higher Oxalis establishment success in species rich habitats. By conducting field sowing tests at multiple sites across a region we found that except for Oxalis, Mediterranean island ecosystems are quite resistant to invader establishment. These results suggest that differences in the degree of invasion between ecosystems and islands might be more dependent upon the influence of invasion event factors (e.g. propagule pressure) or factors acting at a later life-history stages rather than differences in the resistance imposed by ecosystems to invader recruitment. Moreover, our results support the notion that in Mediterranean ecosystems invasions are highly idiosyncratic events and strongly dependent on water availability conditions.",Web of Science,Ailanthus altissima (P.

We simulated expansion from terrestrial to aquatic habitats in the amphibious stoloniferous alien invasive alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) by growing basal ramets of clonal fragments in soils connected (allowing integration) or disconnected (preventing integration) to the apical ramets of the same fragments submerged in water to a depth of 0, 5, 10 or 15 cm. Clonal integration significantly increased growth and clonal reproduction of the apical ramets, but decreased both of these characteristics in basal ramets. Consequently, integration did not affect the performance of whole clonal fragments. We propose that alligator weed possesses a double-edged mechanism during population expansion: apical ramets in aquatic habitats can increase growth through connected basal parts in terrestrial habitats; however, once stolon connections with apical ramets are lost by external disturbance, the basal ramets in terrestrial habitats increase stolon and ramet production for rapid spreading.

However, given that hybridization is not rare in plants, we should expect some fraction of invasive taxa to be hybrids, even in the absence of an underlying causal relationship. Here, we test the hypothesis that hybridization leads to invasiveness by asking whether the number of hybrids and the numbers of naturalized, weedy, and invasive taxa are correlated across 256 vascular plant families. Data were derived from six regional floras and three global databases listing weeds and invasives. To account for phylogenetic nonindependence, we combined a supertree analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts. After correcting for family size and phylogeny, we conclude that vascular plant families with a higher propensity for hybridization are not more likely to produce more naturalized, weedy, or invasive species than families less prone to hybridization. Instead, hybridization-prone families were in some cases associated with fewer naturalized species and invaders. We present two hypotheses for these patterns, one based on Levin's (Syst Bot 31:8-12, 2006) ideas on reproductive interference and another based on Darwin's naturalization hypothesis.

One of the most popular single-factor hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the naturalization and spread of introduced species is the enemy release hypothesis (ERH).

In this study, we compared the palatability of native and exotic freshwater plants in both phylogenetic pairings and in region-wide assays, using a generalist consumer (the pond snail Radix swinhoei). 3. Our study indicated that, when plants were paired by taxonomic relatedness, the snail preferred native over exotic freshwater plants by a 2 : 1 ratio. The snail also preferred native over exotic plants when tested across 20 native and seven exotic species found growing in Liangzi Lake. 4.

We conducted a greenhouse experiment to test this hypothesis by using invasive Solidago canadensis and native Kummerowia striata as model plant species under lead contamination.

Invasive Solidago canadensis, native Kummerowia striata, and their combination were grown Linder each Pb treatment. Under monoculture no differences of biomass, nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) contents in S. canadensis were found among treatments, but the growth of native K. striata was significantly depressed at higher soil Pb concentration. When both species were mixed, elevated soil Pb concentrations significantly increased shoot biomass ratio of S. canadensis to K. striata, implying that Pb enhanced the competition of S. canadensis over K. striata. Compared to monoculture, biomass and N and P contents of S. canadensis significantly increased under mixture with K. striata in each Pb treatment.

However, the mechanisms by which invasive plants affect soil pathogens were less well known. We conducted four experiments to test the hypothesis that the invasive plant species Solidago canadensis L. may affect soilborne pathogens through exudation of allelochemicals. Two common soilborne pathogens Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani were used in the study. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) variety Qianhong No. 1 which is sensitive to soil pathogens P. ultimum and R. solani was used to indicate pathogenic activity (in terms of seedling mortality and damping-off). Extracts from root and rhizome of S. canadensis significantly suppressed the growth and pathogenic activity of both pathogens under Petri dish culture and sand culture (experiments 1 and 2), providing direct evidence that S. canadensis exerts allelopathic effects on these pathogens. Subsequently, a pathogen inoculation experiment under sand culture showed that pathogenic activity of both P. ultimum and R. solani was lower under the soil with S. canadensis compared to that under the soil with a common native plant Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindl (experiment 3), implying that invasive S. canadensis had but native K. striata did not have allelopathic effects on soil pathogens through root and rhizome exudation. Finally, results from field soil tests showed that mortality and damping-off rate of tomato seedlings were significantly lower under the soils collected from the fields dominated by S. canadensis than that dominated by native plants at both sampling sites, suggesting that suppression of pathogens also occurs in the field. From the present experimental results we suggest that invasive S. conadensis may acquire spreading advantage in non-native habitat by using 'novel weapons' to inhibit not only local plants but also soilborne pathogens.

Both alien and native species were classified with respect to mean proportion of urban land cover in the 1-km grid squares in which the species occurs (urbanity), and absolute frequency in highly urban grid squares (urban frequency). Bayesian regression models were then developed for both measures, with a wide range of plant traits as explanatory variables. 3. Results for aliens and natives and for both urban measures were remarkably similar: the single, coherent picture of 'successful urban species' that emerges from our analysis is of robust plants of relatively fertile, dry, unshaded, base-rich habitats. Only seed mass behaved very differently for natives and aliens; seed mass was related positively to success of urban natives, and negatively to success of urban aliens. Neither clonality, seed dispersal nor seed persistence in the soil were strongly linked to success in urban habitats. 4. Synthesis.

General guidelines for invasive plant management are currently lacking. Population declines may be achieved by focusing control on demographic processes (survival, growth, fecundity) with the greatest impact on population growth rate. However, we often have little demographic information on populations in the early stages of an invasion when control can be most effective. Here we determine whether synthesis of existing demographic data on invasive and native plant populations can address this knowledge problem. 2. We compared population dynamics between invasive and native species using published matrix population models for 21 invasive and 179 native plant species. We examined whether the population growth rate responsiveness to survival, growth and fecundity perturbations varied between invasive and native species, and determined which demographic processes of invaders to target for reductions in population growth rate. 3. Invaders had higher population growth rates (lambda) than natives, resulting in differences in demographic processes. Perturbations of growth and fecundity transitions (elasticities) were more important for population growth of invaders, whereas perturbations of survival had greater importance for population growth of natives. 4. For both invasive and native species, elasticities of lambda to survival increased with life span and decreased with lambda; while elasticities to growth and fecundity decreased with life span and increased with lambda. 5. For long-lived invaders, simulated reductions in either survival, growth or fecundity transitions were generally insufficient to produce population declines, whereas multiple reductions in either survival + growth or survival + fecundity were more effective. For short-lived invaders, simulated reductions in growth or fecundity and all pairwise multiple reductions produced population declines. 6. Synthesis and applications. Life history and population growth rate of invasive species are important in the selection of control targets. For rapidly growing populations of short-lived invaders, growth and fecundity transitions should be prioritized as control targets over survival transitions. For long-lived invaders, simultaneous reductions in more than one demographic process, preferably survival and growth, are usually required to ensure population decline. These general guidelines can be applied to rapidly growing new plant invasions and at the invasion front where detailed demographic data on invasive species are lacking.",Web of Science,Many,,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,High Reprod.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to estimate the effects of lead on the growth and mycorrhizae of an invasive species (Solidago canadensis L.) in a microcosm system. Each microcosm unit was separated into HOST and TEST compartments by a replaceable mesh screen that allowed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal hyphae rather than plant roots to grow into the TEST compartments. Three Pb levels (control, 300, and 600 mg/kg soil) were used in this study to simulate ambient soil and two pollution sites where S. canadensis grows. Mycorrhizal inoculum, comprised five indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species (Glomus mosseae, Glomus versiform, Glomus diaphanum, Glomus geosporum, and Glomus etunicatum). The N-15 isotope tracer was used to quantify the mycorrhizally mediated nitrogen acquisition of plants. The results showed that S. canadensis was highly dependent on mycorrhizae. The Pb additions significantly decreased biomass and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization (root length colonized, RLC%) but did not affect spore numbers, N (including total N and N-15) and P uptake. The facilitating efficiency of mycorrhizae on nutrient acquisition was promoted by Pb treatments. The Pb was mostly sequestered in belowground of plant (root and rhizome). The results suggest that the high efficiency of mycorrhizae on nutrient uptake might give S. canadensis a great advantage over native species in Pb polluted soils.",Web of Science,Solidago canadensis L.,China,Zhejiang Province,,28.54,118.3,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

To address these issues, we established plant assemblages that varied in native species and functional richness and crossed this gradient in diversity with resource (water) addition. Identical assemblages were either uninvaded or invaded with one of three exotic forbs: spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), or sulfur cinquefoil (Potentilla recta). To determine impacts, we measured the effects of exotics on native biomass and, for spotted knapweed, on soil moisture and nitrogen levels. Assemblages with high species richness were less invaded and less impacted than less diverse assemblages. Impact scaled with exotic biomass; spotted knapweed had the largest impact on native biomass compared with the other exotics. Although invasion depressed native biomass, the net result was to increase total community yield. Water addition increased invasibility (for knapweed only) but had no effect on invader impact.

Moreover, although genetic differences between populations in their native versus invasive ranges may simply reflect different positions along a genetic latitudinal cline, this has rarely been controlled for. To study non-adaptive evolutionary processes in invasion of Mimulus guttatus, we used allozyme analyses on offspring of seven native populations from western North America, and three and four invasive populations from Scotland and New Zealand, respectively. To study quantitative genetic differentiation, we grew 2474 plants representing 17 native populations and the seven invasive populations in a common greenhouse environment under temporarily and permanently wet soil conditions. The absence of allozyme differentiation between the invasive and native range indicates that multiple genotypes had been introduced to Scotland and New Zealand, and suggests that founder effects and genetic drift played small, if any, roles in shaping genetic structure of invasive M. guttatus populations. Plants from the invasive and native range did not differ in phenology, floral traits and sexual and vegetative reproduction, and also not in plastic responses to the watering treatments. However, plants from the invasive range produced twice as many flower-bearing upright side branches than the ones from the native populations. Further, with increasing latitude of collection, vegetative reproduction of our experimental plants increased while sexual reproduction decreased. Plants from the invasive and native range shared these latitudinal clines. Because allozymes showed that the relatedness between native and invasive populations did not depend on latitude, this suggests that plants in the invasive regions have adapted to the local latitude. Overall, our study indicates that quantitative genetic variation of M. guttatus in its two invasive regions is shaped by adaptive evolutionary processes rather than by non-adaptive ones.

Plant pathogens can have major impacts on diverse taxa and ecological systems world-wide, and some of the most conspicuous of these are invasive non-native species. Although many factors are known to influence the distribution and abundance of plant pathogens, the extent to which humans play a role is less well-known but still critical for understanding the dynamics of invasive pathogens in natural systems. 2. One invasive pathogen of great concern world-wide is Phytophthora ramorum, which causes Sudden Oak Death, an emerging forest disease. Here, we examined the influence of humans and a range of environmental factors on the distribution of P. ramorum at three distinct spatial scales in northern and central California. 3. At the local scale, P. ramorum more commonly occurred in soil on hiking trails used heavily by humans than in soil from adjacent areas off trails. These results support the hypothesis that humans dispersed the pathogen within already infected areas and into areas lacking local sources of inoculum. 4. At the landscape scale, using a network of 202 randomly located plots across a 275 km(2) area, we found that forests on public land open to recreation exhibited higher prevalence of disease in a critical infectious host tree (bay laurel, Umbellularia californica), than forests on private lands. Infection levels were also higher in plots surrounded by large amounts of forest with warm climatic conditions and greater potential soil moisture. Although prevalence of diseased canker hosts (Quercus agrifolia, Q. kelloggii and Lithocarpus densiflora) was positively associated with dominance of bay laurel and rainy season temperatures, it was not significantly related to public access, and we hypothesize that this occurred because our study area was in the early stages of infection. 5. At the regional scale, the probability of disease occurrence at 165 sites distributed across the geographic range of P. ramorum in California increased significantly as human population density increased in the surrounding area. Chances of infection also increased significantly with precipitation and presence of bay laurel. 6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that human activity - along with temperature, moisture and host composition - is associated with increased prevalence of an influential exotic forest pathogen.

Invasive species usually exhibit different spatial population dynamics in their native and invaded range. This is often attributed to demographic differences, but may be due to differences in dispersal as well. 2. Regardless of how these dispersal and demographic differences from the native range arose, studying how they contributed to increases in population spread rates will increase our understanding of what has made these species invasive. Here we investigate which vital rates and dispersal parameters of the invasive thistle Carduus nutans drive the increases in spread rate in different invaded ranges compared to that in the native range in Eurasia. 3. We construct and analyse spatial integrodifference models that combine structured, local population models with mechanistic (WALD) models of seed dispersal by wind across a homogeneous landscape. Published and new demographic and dispersal data for single populations from the native (France) and invaded (Australia, New Zealand, Kansas and Pennsylvania) ranges were used for the parameterization. 4. We developed a variance decomposition method (c*-LTRE) to analyse the contributions of the changes in the vital rates and dispersal parameters to the increases in the invasion wave speed (c*) estimates for the different invaded ranges compared to that for the native range. 5. The c*-LTRE analysis showed that the net contribution of the dispersal parameters to c* increases varied among the populations from 51% (Australia), to 79% (Kansas), to 80% (New Zealand) and to 85% (Pennsylvanian experiment). Escape from natural enemies that reduce seed set by floral herbivory was important in all invaded ranges. Large positive contributions were also made by increases in rapid growth of seedlings and small rosettes, increases in flowering probabilities and potential seed production, as well as by increased plant height and lower falling velocities of the plumed seeds. 6. Synthesis. By incorporating a mechanistic dispersal model with a structured population model, and by linking this joint model to field data from several continents, we demonstrate the relative importance of dispersal and demography to invasion success.

We carried out a greenhouse experiment where 12 South African and 11 European populations were for several months grown at two levels of nutrient availability, as well as in the presence or absence of a generalist insect herbivore.

In a multiple regression analysis, the density of established P. serotina seedlings was positively correlated with light availability and understorey species richness and negatively correlated with understorey species cover. These results suggest that woody invader success is adversely affected by overstorey shading and understorey competition for resources. Simultaneously, however, invader success may generally be positively associated with understorey species richness because both native and invasive plant colonization respond similarly to environmental conditions, including those influenced by overstorey tree species.

We investigated how gap dynamics in a tropical rain forest on the island of Reunion affected the invasiveness of alien plants. In the 12 000-m(2) study area, alien plants occupied 24.9% of the area of gaps, which represented 5.62% of the forest area, but only 0.8% of the understorey area. The most abundant invasive species was Rubus alceifolius, which formed dense, monospecific stands in the largest gaps (>25 m(2)). Although plants could persist in the shade, a germination experiment revealed that canopy openings were essential for seedling establishment. A cyclone that struck the study area in 2002 caused a temporary thinning of the canopy, increasing light levels to above the threshold needed for germination of R. alceifolius and also stimulating the growth of established plants. We conclude that the ability of this and other alien species to colonize intact lowland tropical rain forest is strongly influenced by the prevailing gap dynamics. Because gaps are also essential for the regeneration of many native trees in our study area, there is a real danger of the forest being progressively degraded by alien plants.

We used 20 468 vegetation plots from 32 habitats in the Czech Republic to compare the invasibility of different habitats. Using regression trees, the proportion of alien plants, including archaeophytes (prehistoric to medieval invaders) and neophytes (recent invaders), was related to variables representing habitat properties, propagule pressure, and climate. The propagule pressure was expressed as the proportion of surrounding urban and industrial or agricultural land, human population density, distance from a river, and history of human colonization in the region. Urban and industrial land use had a positive effect on the proportion of both archaeophytes and neophytes. Agricultural land use, higher population density, and longer history of human impact positively affected the proportion of archaeophytes. Disturbed human-made habitats with herbaceous vegetation were most invaded by both groups of aliens. Neophytes were also relatively common in disturbed woody vegetation, such as broad-leaved plantations, forest clearings, and riverine scrub. These habitats also had the highest proportion of aliens after removing the effect of propagule pressure and climate, indicating that they are not only the most invaded, but also most invasible. These habitats experience recurrent disturbances and are rich, at least temporarily, in available nutrients, which supports the hypothesis that fluctuating resources are the major cause of habitat invasibility. The least invaded habitats were mires and alpine-subalpine grasslands and scrub. After removing the effect of propagule pressure and climate, some habitats actually invaded at an intermediate level had very low proportions of aliens. This indicates that these habitats (e. g., dry, wet, and saline grasslands, base-rich fens, and broad-leaved deciduous woodlands) are resistant to invasion.",Web of Science,Many,Czech Republic,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure;Disturbance,,primary

Probability of naturalization was positively related to the number of native species in a genus but negatively related to native congener abundance, suggesting the importance of both niche availability and biotic resistance. Once naturalized, however, exotic abundance was not related to the number of native congeners, but positively related to native congener abundance.

Thinking about efficiency of resource use in forests. For. Ecol. Manage. 1-2, 5-16). To test the generality of this hypothesis, we estimated annual productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) of an exotic Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco) plantation and a multi-species native forest in N.W. Patagonia, both growing on the same site. We hypothetized that, within a site, the more productive system (a priori the Douglas-fir plantation) has a higher WUE than the less productive system (the native forest), and that within the native forest, the more productive species have higher WUE than the less productive ones. Five taxa were the most conspicuous woody species in the native forest, which was codominated by Nothofagus antarctica and Lomatia hirsuta. Both studied systems had reached their maximum leaf area index (approximately, 5 and 11 for the native and exotic forests, respectively). Annual productivity was 2.3 times higher in the Douglas-fir plantation than in the native forest, however two native! species showed similar values of biomass productivity than the exotic species. The amount of water used by the native system was lower than that used by the Douglas-fir plantation, but not as low as the observed differences in productivity, thus resulting in a higher WUE in the Douglas-fir plantation than in the native forest (1.8 times higher). In addition, WUE was also different among the native species. The lower WUE at the stand level in the case of the native forest probably is due to the presence of retamos and lauras. We concluded that: (1) the more productive system (the Douglas-fir plantation) had a higher WUE than the less productive system (the native mixed forest); (2) within the native mixed forest, the most productive species (L. hirsuta and N. antarctica) had the highest WUE of all native species. Future research is needed to explain the physiological causes (daily patterns of transpiration and carbon fixation and allocation) of the observed differences in WUE between species and whole systems.

Black willow (Salix nigra Marshall) is a flood-tolerant tree native to the southeastern United States and recently invasive in Australia, where it is considered detrimental to riparian environments. Effective management of S. nigra requires understanding the impacts of hydrological conditions on population dynamics at each stage of the plant's life cycle. The influence of inundation events (timing, duration, and recession rates) on S. nigra stand dynamics and relative growth rate (RGR) was quantified across a hydrological gradient on the shorelines of Blowering Dam reservoir (NSW, Australia). Successful recruitment (sexual and asexual) and establishment is highly dependent on the position of S. nigra recruits above reservoir water levels and exposure to flooding during the first few years of establishment. Recruitment was ubiquitous along the hydrological gradient but a greater number of asexual recruits were found at higher elevations where inundation events are less frequent. Juvenile mortality was highest at lower elevations, which experienced greater depth and duration of inundation. Mean RGR was greatest in S. nigra stands experiencing no inundation over the study period and declined as inundation duration increased. Flooding events inhibit adult growth, but create suitable conditions for seedling recruits, provided the depth and duration of the flood does not exceed complete submersion for more than 30 days. To investigate relative tolerance to water table decline rooted S. nigra cuttings were grown in rhizopods, controlled growth devices that allow water-table manipulation. Water-table decline rates of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 cm day(-1) were applied and the response of leaf abscission measured. S. nigra cuttings were not significantly impacted at water-table decline rates of between 1 and 4 cm day(-1). Spatial location of S. nigra recruits in Australian floodplains represents a trade-off among hydrological conditions that promote recruitment without inducing mortality, resulting in a narrow spatial and temporal regeneration window critical to successful establishment. Future distribution and abundance of S. nigra in Australia will be determined by propagule availability and the degree to which current and future flow regimes create suitable hydrological conditions for successful establishment.",Web of Science,Salix nigra,Australia,New South Wales,Blowering Dam reservoir,-35.4167,148.2333,Field - Observational;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Fluctuating Resources,,primary

Previously described population structure at these loci in North America conferred geographic information to genotypes. B. glandula from Argentina and southern to central California shared genotypes not found in other native populations. B. glandula from Japan and the northeastern Pacific (Puget Sound and Alaska) were differentiated from other populations by the presence of a nearly fixed nucleotide in EF1 and contained all 3 major haplotype groups of COI. These patterns indicate that sources of B, glandula in Japan and Argentina are largely from Alaska/Puget Sound and California, respectively. The broad similarity of mean seawater temperatures among introduced and native regions may have facilitated these invasions.

However, resource limitation is not of overriding importance in all systems, as exemplified by marine soft sediments, one of Earth's most widespread habitat types. Here, we tested the disturbance-invasion hypothesis in a marine soft-sediment system by altering rates of biogenic disturbance and tracking the natural colonization of plots by invasive species. Levels of sediment disturbance were controlled by manipulating densities of burrowing spatangoid urchins, the dominant biogenic sediment mixers in the system. Colonization success by two invasive species (a gobiid fish and a semelid bivalve) was greatest in plots with sediment disturbance rates <500 cm(3).m(-2).d(-1), at the low end of the experimental disturbance gradient (0 to >9000 cm(3).m(-2).d(-1)). Invasive colonization declined with increasing levels of sediment disturbance, counter to the disturbance-invasion hypothesis. Increased sediment disturbance by the urchins also reduced the richness and diversity of native macrofauna, (particularly small, sedentary, surface feeders), though there was no evidence of increased availability of resources with increased disturbance that would have facilitated invasive colonization: sediment food resources (chlorophyll a and organic matter content) did not increase, and space and access to overlying water were not limited (low invertebrate abundance). Thus, our study revealed the importance of biogenic disturbance in promoting invasion resistance in a marine soft-sediment community, providing further evidence of the valuable role of bioturbation in soft-sediment systems (bioturbation also affects carbon processing, nutrient recycling, oxygen dynamics, benthic community structure, and so on.). Bioturbation rates are influenced by the presence and abundance of large burrowing species (like spatangoid urchins).

H. matronalis clearly reduced C. rotundifolia and M. montana aboveground growth and maintained its competitive advantage across all treatments.

H. matronalis demonstrated a clearly negative effect on native species, but a particular ability to outcompete native species at high resource levels depended on resource and native species identity. We also expected that the native species would not exploit excess resources as well as H. matronalis, instead growing better under ambient or low resource conditions because of local adaptation.

Questions addressed were (1) do growth trajectories vary significantly among families and between microsites? and (2) does reproductive mass scale with vegetative size? The trajectory for shoot dry mass over time was significantly related to microsite, due apparently to greater growth over the final 8 weeks of plants from the interior compared to those from the edge.

For example, are aliens concentrated in niches under-exploited by native communities, or widely distributed across the ecological spectrum? To explore this question, we compared the niches occupied by 394 naturalized alien plants with a representative sample from the native flora of Mediterranean islands. When niche structure was described by a functional group categorization, the distribution of native and alien species was remarkably similar, although 'succulent shrubs' and 'trees with specialized animal pollination mechanisms' were under-represented in the native species pool. When niche structure was described by Grime's CSR strategy, the positioning of aliens and natives differed more strongly. Stress-tolerance was much rarer amongst the aliens, and a competitive strategy was more prevalent at the habitat level. This pattern is similar to previous findings in temperate Europe, although in those regions it closely reflects patterns of native diversity. Stressed environments are much more dominant in the Mediterranean. We discuss a number of factors which may contribute to this difference, e.g., competitive and ruderal niches are often associated with anthropogenic habitats, and their high invasibility may be due partly to introduction patterns rather than to a greater efficiency of aliens at exploiting them. Thus far, the reasons for invasion success amongst introduced species have proved difficult to unravel. Despite some differences, our evidence suggests that alien species naturalize across a wide range of niches.

A. donax shoot emergence, survival time, and shoot height were recorded for approximately 10 months. The experiment was repeated over three years in different locations within each site.

The combination of three drivers: human-introduced disease, climate warming and a fisheries-mediated increase in seabird populations, removed major constraints on plant population growth, (i.e. grazer control, climatic control, germination opportunity and nutrient limitation). Collectively, these changes created optimal conditions for the rapid expansion of tree mallow. The resulting dramatic impact on both the native vegetation and breeding seabirds, notably puffins (Fratercula arctica), exemplifies how non-native invasive plant species can transform terrestrial ecosystems. While climate change is regarded as a key factor behind plant invasion, we highlight that multiple rather than single factors may be critical to biodiversity loss.",Web of Science,Lavatera arborea,Scotland,Craigleith,,56,-2,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance;Climate Change;Other,,primary

However, ecologists have long recognized that disturbance also promotes exotic plant invasions. Cyclones cause extensive defoliation, loss of major branches and multiple tree falls, resulting in a significantly more open canopy and increased light and heat levels in the understorey. The widespread and massive disturbance caused by cyclones provides ideal conditions for rapid recruitment and spread of invasive species. The ecological roles of invasive species in rainforest habitats following such a severe disturbance are poorly understood. Severe category 4 Cyclone Larry crossed the North Queensland coast in March 2006 causing massive disturbance to rainforest habitats from Tully to Cairns and west to the Atherton Tablelands. We established 10 plots in an area extensively damaged by this cyclone near El Arish in North Queensland. On each plot nine 2 x 2 m quadrats were established with three quadrats per plot in each of the following treatments: (i) complete debris removal down to the soil layer, (ii) removal of coarse woody debris only, and (iii) uncleared. We monitored recruitment, growth and mortality of all native and invasive species in the 90 quadrats every 3 months since the cyclone. Here we present the recruitment dynamics of invasive species across the study area in relation to the level of disturbance, the type of quadrat treatment, and the diversity and abundance of the native recruiting flora over the first 12 months post-cyclone. Our results suggest that invasive species will mostly comprise a transient component of the flora in the early stages of the successional response. However, some species may have longer-term effects on the successional trajectory of the rainforest and future forest composition and structure.",Web of Science,Many,Australia,Queensland ,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Subtropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Some evidence suggests that disproportionately high densities of some invaders are due to the release of biochemicals that are novel, and therefore harmful, to naive organisms in their new range. So far, such evidence has been restricted to the direct phytotoxic effects of plants on other plants. Here we found that one of North America's most aggressive invaders of undisturbed forest understories, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and a plant that inhibits mycorrhizal fungal mutualists of North American native plants, has far stronger inhibitory effects on mycorrhizas in invaded North American soils than on mycorrhizas in European soils where A. petiolata is native. This antifungal effect appears to be due to specific flavonoid fractions in A. petiolata extracts. Furthermore, we found that suppression of North American mycorrhizal fungi by A. petiolata corresponds with severe inhibition of North American plant species that rely on these fungi, whereas congeneric European plants are weakly affected. These results indicate that phytochemicals, benign to resistant mycorrhizal symbionts in the home range, may be lethal to naive native mutualists in the introduced range and indirectly suppress the plants that rely on them.",Web of Science,Alliaria petiolata,United States; Germany; Spain,Vermont; Oregon; Massachusetts; Montana,,42.8717;45.505;42.5233;46.8833,-73.1883;-122.69;-72.185;-113.9717,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Novel Weapons,,primary

We analyzed the invasion of Trifolium (true clover) species into New Zealand, assessing a range of human, biogeographic, and biological influences at three key invasion stages: introduction, naturalization, and spread. We used sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) to define suites of related attributes and aggregated boosted trees to model relationships with invasion outcomes. Human and biogeographic attributes were strongly associated with success at all stages. Whereas biogeographic attributes, notably large native range, were consistently associated with success, different human factors appeared to favor success at different stages, such as presence in early trade/immigration hotspots (introduction), intentional large-scale planting (naturalization), and frequent presence as a seed contaminant (relative spread rate). Biological traits were less strongly associated with success for introduction and spread and little if at all for naturalization; we found that tall perennials with long flowering periods were more frequently selected for introduction, whereas species With extended flowering in New Zealand spread more rapidly. In addition to causal relationships, the importance of human factors may reflect indirect associations, including ecological traits associated with both human use and invasion. Nevertheless, our results highlight key roles that humans can play in facilitating plant invasion via two pathways: (i) commercial introduction leading to widespread planting and concomitant naturalization and spread and (h) unintentional introduction and spread of species associated with human activities, such as seed contaminants.",Web of Science,Trifolium ,New Zealand,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Urban;Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

To understand the processes underlying this shift we grew Phragmites and Melaleuca alone and together under contrasting sediment organic-matter loadings and salinities. To examine if the capacity of Phragmites to aerate the sediment influenced plant interactions, we also dissipated convective gas flow in some Phragmites plants by perforating their stems. Although Phragmites suppressed the growth of Melaleuca under all conditions, Melaleuca persisted. We did not find Phragmites ramets to be more sensitive to salinity than Melaleuca seedlings. Surprisingly Phragmites did not increase sediment redox and was more sensitive to increased organic-matter loading than Melaleuca. These results do not support the notion that colonisation by Melaleuca was facilitated by a decline in Phragmites at higher salinities or through aeration of the sediments by Phragmites. Seedlings of Melaleuca, however, were easily blown over by wind and it is likely that Phragmites stands shelter Melaleuca during establishment.

We demonstrated that nests of the leaf-cutting ant, Acromyrmex lobicornis, near roadsides promote the abundance, growth and reproduction of two exotic plant species, Carduus nutans and Onopordum acanthium, in a national park in northern Patagonia, Argentina and determine the mechanisms that produce these effects. Refuse dumps (RDs) from ant nests have a higher nutrient content than nearby non-nest soils (NNSs); foliar nutrient content and their N-15 isotopic signature strongly suggest that plants reach and use these nutrients. Both species of exotic plants in RDs were 50-600% more abundant; seedlings had 100-1000% more foliar area and root and leaf biomass; and adult plants produced 100-300% more seeds than nearby NNS plants. Plants can thus gain access to and benefit from the nutrient content of ant RD, supporting the hypotheses that enhanced resource availability promotes exotic plant performance that could increase the likelihood of biological invasions. The two exotics produce an estimated of 8 385 000 more seeds ha(-1) in areas with ant nests compared with areas without; this exceptional increase in seed production represents a potential threat to nearby non-invaded communities. We propose several management strategies to mitigate this threat.

I use demographic models parameterized from common garden experiments to develop hypotheses about the role of different life stage transitions in determining differences in performance in invasive and noninvasive congeners in the Commelinaceae. I also extended nested life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses to accommodate interactions between nested and unnested factors. Invasive species outperformed their noninvasive congeners, especially under high-nutrient conditions. This difference in performance did not appear to be due to differences in elasticities of vital rates, but rather to differences in the magnitude of stage transitions. Self-compatible invasive species had greater fecundity in high-nutrient environments and a shorter time to first reproduction, and all invasive species had greater vegetative reproduction than their noninvasive congeners. Thus greater opportunism in sexual and asexual reproduction explained the greater performance of invasive species under high-nutrient conditions. Similar common garden experiments could become a useful tool to predict potential invaders from pools of potential introductions.

Because there were no sentinel traps in place, considerable spread had occurred before the eradication campaign started. The distribution of fly density around the epicentre in the town of Cairns and a transect along the main traffic routes to the north and south fitted a Cauchy model with a tail having the same slope as a power model with an exponent of -2.4 extending to 160 km. The Cauchy model indicated that 50% of the flies on the transect would have occurred within 3.2 km of the epicentre, 90% within 13.2 km, and 99% within 60 km. The two major satellites at Mareeba (35 km from the epicentre in Cairns) and Mossman (65 km) were not used for the transect data and had respectively 15 and 30 times the density predicted by the model. The proportion of traps that caught flies (a measure of site occupancy) fell with distance from the epicentre. B. papayae was trapped consistently on only three of the 16 rainforest transects that were surveyed and these were relatively close to urban areas where eradication efforts were intense. Despite there being no eradication effort in the rainforest, the trends to extinction were similar to those in adjacent areas.

Methods: We used partial correlation and factor analysis to investigate relationships between native ground cover plant species richness and composition, percent cover of Lonicera japonica, and local and landscape-level environmental variables and disturbance patterns in mature upland forests. We directly measured vegetation and environmental variables within 34 sampling subplots and quantified the amount of tree cover surrounding our plots using digital color aerial photography. Results: Simple bivariate correlations revealed that high species richness and a high proportion of herbs were associated with low Lonicera japonica cover, moist and sandy uncompacted soils, low disturbance in the surrounding landscape, and periodic prescribed burning. Partial correlations and factor analysis showed that once we accounted for the environmental factors, L. japonica cover was the least important predictor of composition and among the least important predictors of species richness. Hence, much of the negative correlation between native species diversity and this invasive species was explained by soil texture and local and landscape-level land-use practices.

On the basis of EICA, there should be selection for competitive ability without herbivores and selection for defense with herbivores. Selection on competitive ability should be stronger for genotypes accustomed to herbivores (home range genotypes), and selection on defense should be stronger for genotypes unaccustomed to herbivores (introduced range genotypes). Using a field experiment, we tested these hypotheses for the invasive plant Melaleuca quinquenervia. There was a negative genetic correlation between resistance and growth, indicating a trade-off. However, selection for stem elongation (an indicator of competitive ability) was always positive, and selection on resistance was always negative and did not depend on genotype source or the presence of herbivores.

Interspecific competition has often been suggested as a mechanism for replacement of one species by another, but this is rarely tested. We investigated the potential of an invasive alien tree to transform vegetation by quantifying the relative abilities of the alien tree Schinus molle and dominant native trees Acacia tortilis and Rhus lancea to compete for light when growing in association within a South African semi-arid savanna. Due to dispersal of its fruits by birds, seedlings of S. molle establish under tree canopies. Using canopy symmetry as an index of ability to compete for light, we found that the alien S. molle consistently out-competes the dominant native tree species. The results also show that pod, production of A. tortilis was higher when it grew alone compared to when it grew with S. molle or R. lancea. The percentage of dead branches was higher on A. tortilis trees growing in association with the S. molle. The outcome is that the alien tree will gradually increase in abundance, changing woodland structure and ecosystem processes. Our findings provide evidence for the role of competition in the process of alien plant invasions. We suggest that S. molle, previously considered a benign naturalized species in South Africa, should be declared a noxious weed in some parts of that country. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The finding of parallel patterns of genetically based clinal variation in native and non-native ranges across similar environmental gradients supports the hypothesis that adaptive evolution has played a role in establishment and spread.

Significant clinal variation in phenotype corresponding to latitude was found among US and Japanese populations for height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, stem diameter, and stomatal guard-cell size. Only the slope of leaf width differed significantly between the native and invasive range, and the slope was significantly steeper in Japan. These results indicate that patterns of selection across latitude are similar in these two countries.

Yet, when resource quality is asymmetric, the species that monopolizes the more profitable resource following character displacement may have higher fitness and therefore be deemed the 'winner'. Here, we ask: does the winner tend to be the resident species (i.e. the earlier inhabitant of the geographic region where character displacement occurred) or the invader (i.e. the subsequent inhabitant of the region)? We focus on two spadefoot toad species that have undergone character displacement. Previous studies revealed that Spea bombifrons gains the higher quality resource following character displacement; consequently, Spea multiplicata must use the lower quality resource, and as a result, experiences negative fitness consequences. Where the two species have undergone character displacement, three lines of evidence implicate S. bombifrons as the invader: S. bombifrons possess lower haplotype and nucleotide diversity; they do not exhibit isolation by distance (in contrast to S. multiplicata); and they display much higher population growth rates. We hypothesize that historical patterns of selection in its ancestral range pre-adapted S. bombifrons to evolve phenotypes capable of monopolizing the superior resource.

This is because many biological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors interact to determine the distribution of invasive species. However, in this paper we also argue that many analyses of invasiveness have been flawed by not considering several fundamental issues: (1) the range size of an invasive species depends on how much time it has had to spread (its residence time); (2) the range size and spread rate are mediated by the total extent of suitable (i.e. potentially invasible) habitat; and (3) the range size and spread rate depend on the frequency and intensity of introductions (propagule pressure), the position of founder populations in relation to the potential range, and the spatial distribution of the potential range. We explored these considerations using a large set of invasive alien plant species in South Africa for which accurate distribution data and other relevant information were available. Species introduced earlier and those with larger potential ranges had larger current range sizes, but we found no significant effect of the spatial distribution of potential ranges on current range sizes, and data on propagule pressure were largely unavailable. However, crucially, we showed that: (1) including residence time and potential range always significantly increases the explanatory power of the models; and (2) residence time and potential range can affect which factors emerge as significant determinants of invasiveness. Therefore, analyses not including potential range and residence time can come to misleading conclusions. When these factors were taken into account, we found that nitrogen-fixing plants and plants invading arid regions have spread faster than other species, but these results were phylogenetically constrained. We also show that, when analysed in the context of residence time and potential range, variation in range size among invasive species is implicitly due to variation in spread rates, and, that by explicitly assuming a particular model of spread, it is possible to estimate changes in the rates of plant invasions through time. We believe that invasion biology can develop generalizations that are useful for management, but only in the context of a suitable null model.",Web of Science,Many,South Africa,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

In contrast, the moderately invaded plant communities displayed increased total root biomass under elevated CO2, while little impact occurred on the relative abundance of soil microbial indicators. Principal components analysis indicated that overall soil microbial community structure was distinct by CO2 level for the varying N and invasion treatments.

Ovigerous females were absent in October and November, and extremely scarce in December when the reproductive season started again slowly. From January to September pre-copulatory pairs and egg-carrying females were present. The reproductive cycle lasted for 9-10 months. 2. Various pigmentation phenotypes of D. villosus have been described in the literature. However, no significant differences were found between the reproductive variables studied here and several colour morphs. Mating was size-assortative; mean body length of males was about 1.3 times greater than that of their potential mates, and the wet weight was approximately twice as heavy. 3. The relationship between the number of embryos per clutch and the wet weight of females was described by a 3-parameter power equation. The population mean was 43 eggs with a range of five to 194 eggs. Eighty-two specimens from 1359 D. villosus females had more than 100 eggs: the smallest of these females was 12 mm long (30 mg) wet weight, and the largest, which was 18 mm long (91 mg), had 194 eggs in embryonic development stage 4. 4. Numbers of embryos in developmental stages 2 (early egg stage) and 7 (newly hatched neonates) differed significantly with body wet weight of ovigerous females (P < 0.05). For an average female in the range 10-12 mm (20-30 mg) the number of juveniles in the brood pouch was 74% of the number of stage 2 eggs. This value can be interpreted as the survival rate of eggs. 5. The overall mean egg volume (EV, +/- 95% CL) of stage 2 eggs of D. villosus was 0.05 +/- 0.001 mm(3), and EV increased significantly at each stage of development. At stage 6, egg volume had increased by a factor of 2.6, and averaged 0.13 +/- 0.001 mm(3). In comparison, G. fossarum and G. roeseli had significantly larger eggs in all developmental stages. 6. Mean egg size of D. villosus (0.063 mm(3)) was maximal in January. For D. villosus (and G. roeseli) the minimum mean egg size occurred in September. In contrast to G. fossarum and G. roeseli, a second peak in egg size was not observed for D. villosus, and egg size fell more or less successively from January to September. 7. A simple index of fecundity was calculated from the number of stage 2 eggs divided by the female's wet weight. The highest values were observed in April and May, when females from the overwintering generation grew to their maximum body size. Thus the release of a large number of neonates corresponds with the availability of plentiful food and rising water temperatures for juvenile growth in the spring. The lowest value occurred in December. In June the small females of a summer generation appeared, with a naturally low fecundity. 8. The relationship between brood development time and water temperature was studied in the laboratory at a series of constant temperatures. At 16 degrees C, mean brood development time was 14 days for D. villosus, compared with about 3 weeks for the indigenous species. At 10 degrees C, mean brood development time was 24 days in D. villosus, compared with 40 days in G. fossarum and 44 days in G. roeseli. At 4 degrees C it was 1.8 and 3.5 times longer in G. fossarum and G. roeseli. 9. The number of offspring produced by a single clutch from a large female D. villosus is considerably higher than the total numbers produced by the indigenous freshwater gammarids, such as G. fossarum, G. roeseli and G. pulex, during their life-spans of 1.5-2 years in seven to nine successive broods. Only one or two large ovigerous D. villosus would probably be enough to start a new population. A potentially high reproductive capacity, comparatively small eggs, optimal timing to release the maximum number of neonates per female in April/May, and a long reproductive cycle, together with rapid development of eggs, rapid growth to sexual maturation, short life span, tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, and exceptional predatory capabilities, all give the invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarid an opportunity to become globally distributed in freshwater ecosystems of the temperate climate zone.",Web of Science,Dikerogammarus villosus,Austria,,Danube,,,Field - Observational,lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances;High Reprod.

However, the influence on invasions of phenotypic plasticity, a key component of many species interactions, is unknown. We present a model in which phenotypic plasticity of a resident species increases its ability to oppose invaders, and plasticity of an invader increases its ability to displace residents. Whereas these effects are expected due to increased fitness associated with phenotypic plasticity, the model additionally reveals a new and unforeseen mechanism by which plasticity affects invasions: phenotypic plasticity increases the steepness of the fitness surface, thereby making invasion more difficult, even by phenotypically plastic invaders. Our results should apply to phenotypically plastic responses to any fluctuating environmental factors including predation risk, and to other factors that affect the fitness surface such as the generalism of predators. We extend the results to competition, and argue that phenotypic plasticity's effect on the fitness surface will destabilize coexistence at local scales, but stabilize coexistence at regional scales. Our study emphasizes the need to incorporate variable interaction strengths due to phenotypic plasticity into invasion biology and ecological theory on competition and coexistence in fragmented landscapes.",Web of Science,,,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,,,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,

Although some analyses seem to support this hypothesis, previous studies have not taken into account differences in the number of plant introductions made to different islands, which will affect invasibility estimates. Furthermore, previous studies have not assessed invasibility in terms of the rates at which introduced plant species attain different degrees invasion or naturalization. I compared the naturalization status of introduced plants on two pairs of Pacific island groups that are similar in most respects but that differ in their distances from a mainland. Then, to factor out differences in propagule pressure due to differing numbers of introductions, I compared the naturalization status only among shared introductions. In the first comparison, Hawai'i (3700 km from a mainland) had three times more casual/weakly naturalized, naturalized and pest species than Taiwan (160 km from a mainland); however, roughly half (54%) of this difference can be attributed to a larger number of plant introductions to Hawai'i. In the second comparison, Fiji (2500 km from a mainland) did not differ in susceptibility to invasion in comparison to New Caledonia (1000 km from a mainland); the latter two island groups appear to have experienced roughly similar propagule pressure, and they have similar invasibility. The rate at which naturalized species have become pests is similar for Hawai'i and other island groups. The higher susceptibility of Hawai'i to invasion is related to more species entering the earliest stages in the invasion process (more casual and weakly naturalized species), and these higher numbers are then maintained in the naturalized and pest pools. The number of indigenous (not endemic) species was significantly correlated with susceptibility to invasion across all four island groups. When islands share similar climates and habitat diversity, the number of indigenous species may be a better predictor of invasibility than indices of physical isolation because it is a composite measure of biological isolation.",Web of Science,Many,Taiwan; New Caledonia; USA,Hawaii,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,Tropical Forest;Subtropical Forest;Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii Girard, was introduced in the Southwest Iberian Peninsula in the 1970's, producing severe impacts on rice agriculture and on native biota such as macrophytes, gastropods, native crayfish and amphibians. We studied the distribution of P. clarkii in two areas of SW Iberian Peninsula: the Sado River basin (SW Portugal), an area colonized by this species around 1990, and the Parque Natural del Entorno de Donana (SW Spain), colonized soon after its introduction in the Iberian Peninsula, in the 1970's. Our main goal was to determine which factors limit crayfish distribution, which could help to identify the most effective management practices to contain its spread. Procambarus clarkii was found in most types of water bodies, including small and shallow ones. Distance to a crayfish source was the single predictor variable explaining crayfish occurrence in most types of habitats and in both areas. The only exception was for the Sado permanent stream points, where crayfish presence was negatively affected by an interaction between elevation and flow velocity. Other habitat characteristics have apparently little or no importance for its successful colonization. Moreover, this study indicated that overland dispersal is apparently a frequent phenomenon in this species. Our findings can be used to determine which habitats are most likely to be colonized by the crayfish and to develop practical measures which may limit its spread and minimize its impacts.",Web of Science,Procambarus clarkii,Portugal,,Sado River,,,Field - Observational,lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,omnivore

Eighty-four forest stands were sampled and species composition and mean percent cover analyzed using ordination methods. Results showed that exotic tree/shrub types were of the most concern for invasion to urban boreal forests and that exotic species type, native habitat and propagule supply may be good indicators of invasive potential. Native forest structure appeared to confer a level of resistance to exotic species and medium to high disturbance intensity was associated with exotic species growth and spread without a corresponding loss in native species richness. Results provided large-scale evidence that diverse communities are less vulnerable to exotic species invasion, and that intermediate disturbance intensity supports species coexistence. From a management perspective, the retention of native species and native forest structure in urban forests is favored to minimize the impact of exotic species introductions, protect natural succession patterns, and minimize the spread of exotic species.",Web of Science,Many,Canada,Alberta,Edmonton,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Coniferous Forest;Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness;Propagule Pressure,,primary

A press removal experiment conducted within a deciduous forest understory community indicated that M. vimineum was a superior competitor to L. japonica. We tested the hypothesis that the competitive success of M. vimineum was because it overgrew, and reduced light available to, L. japonica, by conducting a separate light gradient experiment within the same community. Shade cloth that simulated the M. vimineum canopy reduced the performance of L. japonica. In a third complementary experiment, we added experimental support hosts to test the hypothesis that the competitive ability of L. japonica is limited by support hosts, onto which L. japonica climbs to access light.

We asked whether (1) early successional stages were the most susceptible to C. selloana invasion; (2) soil microdisturbances increased invasion at any point of succession, and (3) C. selloana invasion of later successional stages was modulated by vegetation type Location: Delta del Llobregat (Catalonia, NE Spain). Methods: We monitored survival and growth of transplanted C. selloana seedlings in disturbed and non-disturbed plots throughout a successional gradient with an age range of < 1 to > 10 years in different vegetation types and within the area of influence of coexisting species with similar growth form. Results: Although seedling survival was extremely low in all treatments, our results revealed that early successional stages were not the most easily invaded since we found no significant differences in the percentage survival of C. selloana along the successional gradient. However, survival and seedling biomass were enhanced by soil disturbance at any seral stage. This result suggested that inhibition ruled C. selloana invasion. Invasibility neither depended on the invaded vegetation type nor on the co-existing species with similar growth form. Finally, C. selloana invasion was not enhanced by decreasing competition with Phragntites australis, a native coexisting species because survival rates after a year were not significantly different. However, Phragmites increased C. selloana leaf length probably due to shading.

The PRI and CRI were related to differences in light-use efficiency of each species, as indicated by field measurements of leaf electron transport rate. The suite of hyperspectral metrics indicated maximum differences in the structure, biochemistry, and physiology of Myrica and Metrosideros when canopy vapor pressure deficit was high during hotter and drier periods.

Radio-telemetry was used to determine landscape level factors that influence dispersal of an introduced anuran species (the cane toad) at an invasion front in tropical Australia. Most radio-tracked toads moved along roads and cleared fencelines, avoiding heavily vegetated habitat; they typically sheltered overnight close to these open corridors, returning to the road each evening to recommence dispersal. Surveys of the compass orientation of dispersing toads on roads showed that most animals were oriented along the main axis of the road (and thus, travelling along the road) rather than moving across it. To test the hypothesis that use of roads enables toads to disperse more rapidly than would be possible across more thickly vegetated sites, locomotor performance of toads was quantified under field conditions. As predicted, toads rapidly slowed down in dense roadside vegetation but continued to move rapidly through open areas. These results suggest that simple habitat manipulations of roadside verges might help to reduce the rate of dispersal of cane toads across tropical Australia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of the wild genotype that grows in mature evergreen broadleaf forests in central Kyushu, Japan, with the ecotype invading north central Florida revealed how selection for desirable cultivars might have inadvertently selected for traits that enhance the invasive potential of the species. In Japanese wild populations in deeply shaded evergreen forests, natural selection apparently maintained efficient architecture with a low degree of self-shading and large seed mass to enhance seedling shade tolerance. Cultivar selection for showy appearance can explain the greater fecundity but smaller seed size observed in the Florida populations compared to the Japanese population. Artificial selection for densely foliated appearance can also explain the greater degree of self-shading and less-efficient light use in the Florida genotype compared to the Japanese wild type grown under a common environment. Furthermore, the Florida ecotype allocated more biomass to root carbohydrate storage. These trait modifications resulted in slower growth rates, but greater competitive ability to cast shade upon neighbors and higher resprouting potential in the Florida populations.

We examined 126 invasive alien plant species in China to understand the role of clonality and geographical origin in their invasion success. These species were categorized into three groups (I, II, III) based on their invasiveness in terms of current spatial occupation and the degree of damage to invaded habitats.

There was a significant positive relationship between clonality and species invasiveness. A 68% of the 126 species studied originated in the continent of America (North and/or South America). These preliminary findings support that America is the primary geographical origin of invasive alien plant species in China and that clonality of the invasive plant species contributed significantly to the their invasiveness.

However, our experiments were conducted in artificial environments where competition was probably accentuated. When fungicide was applied to the soil, the biomass of C. solstitialis was reduced in all treatment combinations, but reduction in the biomass of the invader had no corollary impact on the grasses.

For all storage lengths, seeds germinated best at alternating day/night temperatures of 20/5 degrees C. The length of the germination period had a significant effect only at low constant temperatures of 2 and 6 degrees C, where germination percentage increased between 2 and 6 months. Seasonal germination exhibited a distinct pattern, with rapid depletion of seed bank by the first spring after seed burial. Non-dormant seeds were present in the soil early in spring and late in autumn. The higher summer temperatures prevented dormancy breaking and another cold period of at least two months below 10 degrees C was needed to bring non-germinated seeds out of dormancy. The results suggest that (1) seed dormancy of H. mantegazzianum was not completely broken until the first spring, but that some seeds re-enter or retain dormancy during high summer temperatures and that (2) the threshold needed for breaking the dormancy was achieved gradually during the cold autumn and winter months. However, in a small fraction of seeds the dormancy breaking process took several years. Of seeds buried in 10 different regions of the Czech Republic, on average 8.8% survived 1 year, 2.7% 2 years and 1.2% remained viable and dormant after 3 years of burial. The ability of even small fraction of H. mantegazzianum seeds to survive for at least 3 years can result in re-invasion of this species into controlled sites.",Web of Science,Heracleum mantegazzianum,Czech Republic,,Slavkovsky les region,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Coniferous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances,primary

In contrast, anther dehiscence in some flowers can occasionally overlap With stigma receptivity in other flowers in the same umbel, providing an opportunity for geitono-gamous (i.e. between-flower) selfing. Nevertheless, the potential for selfing in H. mantegazzianum is determined mainly by an overlap in the male and female flowering phases between umbels on the same plant; at least a short overlap between some umbels was observed in 99% of the plants at the Slavkovsky les. Although the degree of protandry in H. mantegazzianum favours outcrossing, the opportunity to self may be of crucial importance for an invasive plant, especially if a single plant colonizes a new location. At Slavkovsky les, flowering started within one week (from 20 to 27 June 2002) at all 10 sites. The duration of flowering of an individual plant was on average 36 days, with maximum of 60 days, and increased significantly with the number of umbels on a plant. In the second half of August, the majority of the fruits were ripe and had started to be shed. The beginning of flowering of a plant was significantly negatively correlated With the number of umbels it had - the earlier a plant started to flower the more umbels it had produced. A significant negative relationship was also found between basal diameter and beginning of flowering; plants with large basal diameters started to flower earlier. An average plant at Slavkovsky les produced 20,671 fruits. Of these, 44.6% were produced by the terminal umbel, 29.3% by secondary umbels on satellites, 22.6% by secondary umbels on branches and only 3.5% by tertiary umbels.

Indicators of propagule pressure (number of administrative units in which a species is planted and total planting area) and time of introduction into cultivation were used as explanatory variables in multiple regression models. Fourteen species escaped from cultivation, and 39% of the variance was explained by the number of planting units and the time of introduction, the latter being more important. Species introduced early bad a higher probability of escape than those introduced later, with more than 95% probability of escape for those introduced before 1801 and < 5% for those introduced after 1892. Probability of naturalization was more difficult to predict, and eight species were misclassified. A model omitting two species with the largest influence on the model yielded similar predictors of naturalization as did the probability of escape.

Several general properties have been reported for successful non-indigenous plant species (NIPS). These include presence of a lag time and population expansion following invasion, arrival from a similar climate, ability to self-fertilize, a short lifespan, clonal growth (if perennial), and production of small fruits. We examined these patterns in comparisons of all recorded abundant and rare NIPS in Ontario (n = 1153). We used cross-species and phylogenetic regressions to examine ecological patterns across present-day species and to determine whether evolutionary divergences in NIPS success have been correlated consistently with divergences in any of the life-history traits. We found a significant time lag in invader spread, with species arriving after 1952 being more likely to be rare. Successful invaders (i.e., abundant NIPS) were significantly over-represented among species originating in Europe and Eurasia. Successful invaders were significantly more likely to demonstrate clonal growth, to grow on variable soil moistures, and to have comparatively long flowering periods.

Predicted changes in climate point to a continuation of the recent observed trends in increased precipitation and high-flow events in Northern Europe. 2 The study focused on the dispersal characteristics of M. guttatus, and especially the roles of vegetative fragmentation with increasing water velocities, subsequent fragment survival, regeneration and colonization, as well as the buoyancy, survival and germination success of seeds. 3 M. guttatus was found to fragment readily under velocities typical of high flow conditions and even small fragments had high survival, regeneration and colonization capacity. 4 Large numbers of small (< 0.02 mg) seeds are produced; however, seeds have a short buoyancy period so the timing and magnitude of high-flow events is crucial in determining potential dispersal distances. Seeds germinate readily both in water and on sand with an average 33% germination within 9 days. 5 The dual strategy of dispersal by vegetative fragments and seeds, together with the opportunity of dispersing the two types of propagules during different periods of the year, facilitates local dominance by M. guttatus as well as long-distance colonization. As a result, the rate of spread of M. guttatus into inundation communities along rivers is likely to increase with more frequent high-flow events, especially if these coincide with the growing season. Thus, predicting the response of riparian invasive species to environmental change requires not only an understanding of the role of climate in plant demography but also the impact of changes in hydrology on rates of spread.",Web of Science,Mimulus guttatus,Scotland,,Tarland Burn,57.1167,-2.85,Greenhouse;Lab,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Clonal Reproduction,primary

To test this issue and explore the conditions that foster resistance, we experimentally added Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) seeds to intact forests for 3 years and monitored emergence, survivorship and height growth for 5 years. 2 Seed additions (250 seeds(-1) m(2)) were replicated in situ in combinations of light (deep shade vs. small gaps), soil fertility (NO3 and pH), and variation in soil moisture as influenced by topography (hill slopes vs. flat areas at slope bases) in five eastern deciduous forests in central New York and southern Connecticut. We then parameterized a model with this data to project long-term rates of sapling recruitment. 3 Seedlings had high survival and low growth rates in the deep shade, suggesting that this species readily forms a seedling bank in intact forests. By age 5, annual survivorship reached 93% in deep shade and 98% in small gaps. Median seedling heights were <= 10 cm in all treatments after 5 years, though the largest seedlings were markedly taller in gaps. Mean year 5 densities of all experimental seedlings (ages 3-5 years) were 14 seedlings(-1) m(2) (+/- 2.4 SE) in the shade and 19 seedlings(-1) m(2) (+/- 3.5 SE) in small gaps. 4 While seedlings colonized in all conditions, resistance to invasion varied markedly; resistance was highest in deeply shaded, acidic conditions (pH < 4.5). Small gaps initially promoted invasion, but by age 4 shade survivorship rates were equivalent to gaps. Higher soil pH (especially > 6) also significantly increased survivorship, particularly in deep shade. Shading's main effect was to suppress height growth. Overall, the model predicted impressive sapling recruitment; even in deeply shaded, acidic conditions, approximately 1% of seeds emerge and survive to become saplings. 5 Intact forests only weakly resisted A. platanoides colonization, but strongly suppressed its rate of invasion. As such, the frequency of disturbance, though ultimately unnecessary for A. platanoides invasions, will strongly influence its near-term invasiveness.

Gammarus roeseli is an invasive amphipod, for which the causes of establishment in rivers where the native species, Gammarus pulex, predominates remain unstudied. Freshwater amphipods are important prey for numerous fish predators, but empirical evidence of lower predation rates on exotic prey is scarce. In laboratory experiments, we compared the susceptibility of G. pulex and G. roeseli to fish predation, determined the mechanisms influencing prey selection, and studied the interaction between behavioural and morphological defences. Fish predators (brown trout, Salmo trutta fario) preyed selectively on G. pulex, but not because of differences in attack or capture probability. The presence of spines in G. roeseli appeared to contribute to its underpredation. Differential prey selection in this case might therefore have resulted from the trout's reaction to an adverse stimulus. We found no significant difference in antipredator behaviour between G. pulex and G. roeseli. General behavioural differences were nevertheless found between species, with G. roeseli spending more time under shelters than G. pulex. However, microcosm experiments suggested that this difference was not important for differential predation. Antipredator behaviour may nevertheless be important for G. roeseli against other predators less sensitive to spines. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, mortality and recruitment of B. javanica were lower than those of native species of canopy trees during the survey period.

Natural and semi-natural areas at the urban/wildland interface are threatened by a variety of 'edge effects', and are especially vulnerable to invasion by introduced plants, with suburban gardens acting as significant sources of alien propagules. Urban/wildland interfaces also provide access for humans, leading to various types of disturbance. Alien plant invasions are one of the biggest threats facing remaining natural areas on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The area provides an ideal opportunity to study the dynamics of invasions at the urban/wildland interface, since the largest natural area, the Table Mountain National Park (TMNP), is surrounded by the city of Cape Town. We explored invasion patterns in Newlands Forest (a small section of the TMNP) and detailed the roles of habitat features and distance from putative source populations in three main habitat types: natural Afromontane forest, riverine woodland habitats, and plantations of exotic pines (Pinus radiata and P. pinaster). We also examined the role of disturbance in driving invasions in two of these habitat types (Afromontane forest and pine plantations). We hypothesized that alien richness and alien stem density would decrease with distance from the urban/wildland interface, and that alien richness and alien stem density would increase with increasing levels of human disturbance. Distance from putative source populations and levels of anthropogenic disturbance influenced alien richness in Newlands Forest but not alien stem density. Alien richness decreased significantly with distance from presumed sources in the pine habitat, and increased significantly with disturbance in the forest habitat. Percentage overstorey cover and soil pH were important environmental variables associated with alien plant species. A socio-economic approach is discussed as being the most effective approach to the management and prevention of alien plant species in Newlands Forest. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, insect biological control assumes that herbivory will negatively affect the weed and release natives from competition. Centaurea maculosa, an invader in North America, is tolerant to herbivory, and under some conditions, herbivory may increase its competitive effects on natives. Therefore, we investigated two hypotheses: 1) herbivory stimulates compensatory growth by C. maculosa, which increases its competitive effects, and 2) herbivory stimulates the allelopathic effect of C. maculosa. In the greenhouse, Trichoplusia ni shoot herbivory reduced C. maculosa biomass when shoot damage exceeded 40% of the total original leaf area. Conspecific neighbors had no effect on C. maculosa biomass, and the presence of the natives Festuca idahoensis and F. scabrella had a positive effect on C. maculosa. Neighbors did not alter the effects of shoot herbivory. More importantly, even intense shoot herbivory on C. maculosa did not benefit neighboring plants. In a field experiment, clipping 50% of C. maculosa aboveground biomass in the early summer and again in the late summer reduced final biomass by 40% at the end of the season; however, this clipping did not affect total biomass production or reproductive output. Festuca idahoensis neighbors did not increase the effects of clipping, and aboveground damage to C. maculosa did not release F. idahoensis from competition. In the greenhouse we used activated carbon to adsorb allelochemicals, which reduced the competitive effects of C. maculosa on F. idahoensis but not on F. scabrella or other C. maculosa. However, we found no increase in the allelopathic effects of C. maculosa after shoot herbivory.

We show that in homogeneous landscapes, strong positive feedbacks can influence spreading velocity for annual invaders, but that empirically documented feedbacks are not strong enough to do so. Moreover, to influence spread, invaders must modify the soil environment over a spatial scale larger than is biologically realistic.

Potential ecological consequences of invasion of non-native pollinators include increased pollination and seed set of invasive plants, with subsequent impacts on population growth rates and rates of spread. We outline a quantitative approach for evaluating the impact of a proposed introduction of an invasive pollinator on existing weed population dynamics and demonstrate the use of this approach on a relatively data-rich case study: the impacts on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) from proposed introduction of Bombus terrestris. Three models have been used to assess population growth (matrix model), spread speed (integrodifference equation), and equilibrium occupancy (lattice model) for C. scoparius. We use available demographic data for an Australian population to parameterize two of these models. Increased seed set due to more efficient pollination resulted in a higher population growth rate in the density-independent matrix model, whereas simulations of enhanced pollination scenarios had a negligible effect on equilibrium weed occupancy in the lattice model. This is attributed to strong microsite limitation of recruitment in invasive C. scoparius populations observed in Australia and incorporated in the lattice model. A lack of information regarding secondary ant dispersal of C. scoparius prevents us from parameterizing the integrodifference equation model for Australia, but studies of invasive populations in California suggest that spread speed will also increase with higher seed set. For microsite-limited C. scoparius populations, increased seed set has minimal effects on equilibrium site occupancy. However, for density-independent rapidly invading populations, increased seed set is likely to lead to higher growth rates and spread speeds. The impacts of introduced pollinators on native flora and fauna and the potential for promoting range expansion in pollinator-limited 'sleeper weeds' also remain substantial risks.",Web of Science,"Cytisus scoparius, Bombus terrestris",,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary;herbivore

Consistent with work in other systems, species richness and cover of native plants tended to decrease as intensity of disturbance increased, whereas species richness (but not cover) of non-native plants tended to peak with intermediate disturbance. Our results may suggest that invasions of non-native plants at springs in the Spring Mountains are relatively recent, and that rapid restoration and management actions may help protect ecological processes and viability of native plants.

We measured species composition and a set of geospatial variables on transects at 66 edges in the North Carolina Piedmont in an attempt to distinguish between these two factors. Mantel tests show that species composition is significantly different in forest edges than in the forest interior, but that this effect only penetrates about 5 m into the forest. Indicator species analysis finds several species that are indicative of edge communities, including trumpet vine (Campsis radicans), two drought-tolerant oak species (Quercus stellata and Q. falcata), a serviceberry (Amelanchier arboreum), and a common exotic species, tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima). Poisson regression techniques showed that in both the seedling and tree strata of the forest, exotic species increased in abundance on flat sites with a high potential seed source. Mapping predicted exotic species abundance onto the landscape.

To explore this criticism, we conducted a meta-analysis that examined characteristics of invasiveness (i.e. the ability of species to establish in, spread to, or become abundant in novel communities) and invasibility (i.e. the susceptibility of habitats to the establishment or proliferation of invaders). There were few consistencies among invasiveness characteristics (3 of 13): established and abundant invaders generally occupy similar habitats as native species, while abundant species tend to be less affected by enemies; germination success and reproductive output were significantly positively associated with invasiveness when results from both stages (establishment/spread and abundance/impact) were combined. Two of six invasibility characteristics were also significant: communities experiencing more disturbance and with higher resource availability sustained greater establishment and proliferation of invaders. We also found that even though 'propagule pressure' was considered in only similar to 29% of studies, it was a significant predictor of both invasiveness and invasibility (55 of 64 total cases). Given that nonindigenous species are likely introduced non-randomly, we contend that 'propagule biases' may confound current paradigms in invasion ecology. Examples of patterns that could be confounded by propagule biases include characteristics of good invaders and susceptible habitats, release from enemies, evolution of 'invasiveness', and invasional meltdown. We conclude that propagule pressure should serve as the basis of a null model for studies of biological invasions when inferring process from patterns of invasion.",Web of Science,Many,,,,,,Review/Meta-analysis,,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,primary;herbivore;omnivore;predator;decomposer;filter

We found that four native and one exotic bird species dispersed viable L. maackii seeds. Gut passage through American robins did not inhibit germination, but gut passage through cedar waxwings did. American robins moved mostly along woodlot edges and fencerows, leading us to project that most viable seeds would be defecated in such habitats, which are very suitable for L. maackii.

We surveyed a stand of Sapium sebiferum (Chinese Tallow Tree) that replaced tallgrass prairie in Texas and performed experiments with seeds and seedlings to determine the contributions of recruitment limitation and natural enemy release to allowing such a forest type to persist or to allowing native species to reduce Sapium dominance. The stand was dominated by Sapium, especially for mature trees (> 99) and annual seed input (97) but less so for saplings (80). Field sown Sapium seeds had lower germination and survival rates than Celtis seeds. Together with the extreme dominance of Sapium in seed rain this suggests that native species are currently recruitment limited in this stand by seed supply but not by germination, early growth or survival. To investigate whether Sapium may benefit from low herbivory or diseases, we transplanted Sapium and Celtis seedlings into the forest and manipulated foliar fungal diseases and insect herbivores with sprays. As predicted, insect herbivores caused greater damage to Celtis seedlings than to Sapiumseedlings. However, suppression of insect herbivores caused significantly greater increases in survivorship of Sapium seedlings compared to Celtis seedlings. This suggests that herbivores in the understory of this Sapiumforest may significantly reduce Sapiumseedling success. Such a pattern of strong herbivore impact on seedlings growing near adult conspecifics was unexpected for this invasive species. However, even with insects and fungi suppressed, Sapium seedling performance was poor in this forest. Our results point towards Sapium as a successional species in a forest that will eventually be dominated by native trees that are currently recruitment limited but outperform Sapium in the understory.",Web of Science,Sapium sebiferum,USA,Texas,,,,Field - Experimental;Field - Observational;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

Invasive species had greater fecundity and vegetative reproduction than their noninvasive relatives. The invasive species also had higher relative growth rates, greater specific leaf area, and more plastic root-to-shoot ratios than noninvasive species. However, whether a trait was associated with invasiveness often depended on both environment and relatedness. Invasives had greater sexual and vegetative reproduction, higher specific leaf area, and greater relative growth rates than noninvasive congeners, but only in some environments. Differences between invasive and noninvasive taxa were greatest at high nutrient availabilities.

Location: Semi-arid/arid transition zone in central New Mexico. Methods: Frequency of occurrence, height, and surface area of saplings (n = 134) and patches of adult plants (n = 247) of the invasive shrub, L. tridentata, were measured within a mosaic of ecosystems dominated either by the Chihuahuan Desert species, Bouteloua eriopoda (Poaceae),or the shortgrass steppe species, B. gracilis, located within I km of the L. tridentata-dominated ecosystem. Distances between L. tridentata patches and patch area were used to estimate connectivity as a measure of propagule pressure. Sapling age (estimated from height using previously established relationships) and distance to the L. tridentata-dominated ecosystem was used to evaluate patterns in dispersal. Cover by species or functional group inside each L. tridentata patch was compared with surrounding vegetation to estimate changes in species composition with patch expansion. Results: L. tridentata saplings (< 1%) and adult patches (15%) occurred less frequently in B. gracilis-dominated ecosystems than expected based on areal extent of this ecosystem type. Propagule pressure did not differ with distance from the core ecosystem dominated by L. tridentata. Evidence for both local and long-distance dispersal events was found. Similar relationships between number of plants and patch area in both grassland types indicate similar patterns in patch expansion. Cover of perennial forbs was higher and cover of dominant grasses was lower in L. tridentata patches compared with the surrounding vegetation for both ecosystem types. Conclusions: Spatial variation in L. tridentata saplings and patches at this biome transition zone is related to the different susceptibilities to invasion by two grassland ecosystems. The persistence of grasslands at this site despite region-wide expansion by L. tridentata may be related to the spatial distribution of B. gracilis-dominated ecosystems that resist or deter invasion by this woody plant.",Web of Science,Larrea tridentata,USA,New Mexico,,34.0667,-106.1167,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Propagule Pressure;Other,Effective Disperser,primary

However, release from soil enemies does not explain all plant invasions. The invasion of Anunophila arenaria (marram grass or European beach grass) in California provides an illustrative example for which the enemy release hypothesis has been refuted. To explore the possible role of plant-soil community interactions in this invasion, we developed a mathematical model. First, we analyzed the role of plant-soil community interactions in the succession of A. arenaria in its native range (north-western Europe). Then, we used our model to explore for California how alternative plant-soil community interactions may generate the same effect as if A. arenaria were released from soil enemies. This analysis was carried out by construction of a 'recovery plane' that discriminates between plant competition and plant-soil community interactions. Our model shows that in California, the accumulation of local pathogens by A. arenaria could result in exclusion of native plant species. Moreover, this mechanism could trigger the rate and spatial pattern of invasive spread generally observed in nature. We propose that our 'accumulation of local pathogens' hypothesis could serve as an alternative explanation for the enemy release hypothesis to be considered in further experimental studies on invasive plant species.",Web of Science,Anunophila arenaria,USA,California,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

Relationships between the environmental factors and the extrinsic and intrinsic attributes of species were investigated using RLQ analysis, a multivariate method for relating a species-attribute table to an environmental table by way of a species presence/absence table. We then clustered species according to their position on the RLQ axes, and tested these groups for phylogenetic independence. The first three axes of the RLQ explained 99% of the variation and were strongly related to the species attributes. The clustering showed that, after accounting for environmental factors, the spatial pattern of IAS in South Africa was driven by human uses, life forms, and reproductive traits. The seven clusters of species strongly reflected geographical distribution, but also intrinsic species attributes and patterns of human use. Two of the clusters, centered on the genera Acacia and Opuntia, were phylogenetically non-independent.

In each site, we established a 30 X 150 m sample grid that spanned a visible leading edge of earthworm invasion and sampled earthworm populations and understory vegetation over four years. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with decreasing diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants in two of four study sites, and the abundance and density of tree seedlings decreased in three of four study sites. Sample points with the most diverse earthworm species assemblage, independent of biomass, had the lowest plant diversity. Changes in understory plant community composition were most affected by increasing biomass of the earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus. Where L. rubellus was absent there was a diverse community of native herbaceous plants, but where L. rubellus biomass reached its maximum, the herbaceous-plant community was dominated by Carex pensylvanica and Arisaema triphyllum and, in some cases, was completely absent.

We sampled 26 of these springs, documenting all associated plant species and their status (native, non-native, invasive) and analyzed whether vegetation patterns are related to spring orientation or to spring area. Two-way ANOVA results show that non-native and invasive species, namely Nasturtium officinale (watercress, Brassicaceae), are significantly more abundant than natives in north-facing springs (p < 0.01), but not in south-facing springs. Generally, native species are restricted to, or more abundant in, south-facing springs, and may have a microtopographical preference for these sites, which may receive more direct solar radiation. Nasturtium officinale, the most abundant invasive species, has high cover values in both north and south orientations and is less restricted in its distribution. Correlation analysis shows that the larger the spring, the higher the percent of Nasturtium (p < 0.01) and invasive species cover (as a percent of spring area) (p < 0.005). Larger springs often had slower moving water and this may have contributed to the success of Nasturtium, which may outcompete shade-intolerant natives in the larger springs.

One reason underlying disparate conclusions may be the different spatial scales at which data have been collected. We compared the distribution and abundance of native unionid mussels and Corbicula at two spatial scales, stream reaches and 0.25 m(2) patches, within one biogeographic region, the Ouachita Highlands, of the south central U.S. We found that Corbicula abundance was negatively related to native mussel abundance at small spatial scales. While Corbicula densities varied widely in patches without native mussels, and in patches where mussels occurred at low abundance, Corbicula density was never high in patches where mussels were dense. We hypothesize that the likelihood of successful Corbicula invasion decreases with increasing abundance of adult native mussels. Several mechanisms may potentially drive this pattern including lack of space for Corbicula to colonize, physical displacement by actively burrowing mussels, and locally reduced food resources in patches where native mussels are feeding. In addition, Corbicula may be unable to withstand environmental bottlenecks as readily as unionids. When patch-scale density and biomass information were pooled to represent entire stream reaches, the negative relationship between native mussels and Corbicula was no longer as apparent, and there was not a significant relationship between native mussels and Corbicula.

However, invasion may be also associated with conditions of plant stress, either nutrient depletion or toxicity, in the environment. In this study, we investigate the possible role of nutrient stress in the invasion of Hieracium lepidulum (Stenstroem) Omang, in South Island, New Zealand. We do this by comparing several performance attributes, and their plasticity, for H. lepidulum and a number of co-occurring species, across a series of nutrient depletion and toxicity tests. H. lepidulum had intermediate yields, high root:shoot ratios and high tissue nutrient contents at control. nutrient concentrations. H. lepidulum differed in eclaphic tolerance from all but Chionochloa flovescens var. brevis, in being insensitive to nutrient dilutions other than nitrogen. The significance of performance in terms of eclaphic tolerance and adaptations are discussed. Intermediate yields at control nutrient levels suggest that H. lepidulum should not be competitive compared to high yielding species including Agrostis stolonifera and Poo cita, but should be competitive with lower yielding Coprosma rugosa and C. flavescens var. brevis. Conversely, significant yield decreases under nitrogen (imitation stress suggests that H. lepidulum will not likely occupy very nutrient poor sites. H. lepidulum, along with C. flavescens var. brevis, were found to be tolerant of ammonium as an alternative source of nitrogen, while other species were not. These data suggest that H. lepidulum and C. flavescens var. brevis would be relatively tolerant of the stresses associated with acidic soils compared to the other species, but not to stresses associated with absolute shortage of nitrogen. Combined results point to the likely occurrence of H. tepidutum at sites of intermediate fertility.

We examined the pollination and gamete production of Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis (L.) L. Bol. and C. edulis (L.) N. E. Br. invading the coasts of southeast France (Provence), and found preliminary evidence that the pollen-mediated gene flow potential (PMGFP) within the four studied populations is positively correlated with their Relative Performance in Hybridization indices (RPH), suggesting a link between pollinator services, gene flow, and Carpobrotus hybridization. Flower density (FD) may be a driver behind pollinator abundance and visitation patterns since it shows a significant, positive relationship with relative pollinator abundance (FR) and a significant negative relationship with per flower visit frequencies (FR/F). In the populations with the highest RPH indices, and therefore high hybrid vigor, both taxa produce similar quantities of ovules and pollen per flower, whose ratios further indicate (facultative) xenogamy. Pollen diameter distributions include similar to 25% micro-pollen, and overall viability is less than one half. Viable pollen profiles consist of 3.5% micro, 85.5% normal and 10.9% macro pollen (considered as diplogametes) on average per flower for C. affine acinaciformis, and 0.7% micro, 73.0% normal and 26.2% macro pollen for C. edulis. Given the co-occurrence of (1) (facultative) xenogamic breeding strategies, (2) a significant, positive relationship between RPH and PMGFP, and (3) frequent pollen abnormalities, it is probable that hybrid dysgenesis mediated by the local pollinators occurs in these populations.

Results supported the initial hypothesis. Both space availability and nutrient enrichment facilitated the establishment and spread of S. muticum in the experimental plots. Established S. muticum plants grew faster in enriched plots than in controls. Furthermore, different successional assemblages played different roles in resisting invasion as S. muticum's life cycle progressed. In the initial stage of the invasion, the Bifurcaria bifurcata canopy inhibited recruitment by S. muticum, whereas understory species did not have a significant effect on invasion success. In contrast, an increased survivorship of S. muticum beneath the canopy of B. bifurcata was observed in those plots where S. muticum had successfully recruited.

Major goals were to characterize species distribution regarding diverse environmental and habitat features, and to explore floodplain landforms relations using plant assemblages and invasion responses as biological indicators of aquatic-terrestrial connectivity. A floristic survey was undertaken during May and early June 1998 in six sites of a southern Iberian basin. Vegetation data were gathered from three transects in three landforms: inundated and frequently flooded banks (FF), infrequently flooded valley floors (IF), and rarely flooded higher floodplains (RF). We used 2x2 m plots to record each species present and visual estimates of percentage cover of each species. Cover of native and exotic species assemblages were also estimated for each plots, for the transects, and for the landforms. The total number of vascular plant species found was 287 of which only 26 were exotic. Despite the high environmental and geomorphological variability, the hierarchical classification showed that species composition varied across the floodplain, rather than along the river. The IF and RF landforms were the most species-rich, both for native and exotic species group, whereas the cover trends of exotic and native plant species were opposed, with exotics being consistently more abundant in FF, and native cover increasing towards RF landforms. We found positive correlations between native and exotic species richness on the floodplain scale, and on a smaller scale in FF and IF landforms, thus supporting the hypothesis that in aquatic and riparian ecosystems of semi-arid landscapes, species-rich communities are preferentially colonized by exotic species.

We censused 20 x 20 m plots for vegetation cover and environmental characteristics in the center of twenty randomly-selected Robinia pseudoacacia stands. Additionally, paired plots were surveyed under native overstory stands, comprised largely of pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and mixed pitch pine-oak (Quercus velutina and Quercus alba) communities. These native stands were located 20 m from the edge of the sampled locust stand and had similar land use histories. To determine the historical distribution of black locust in CCNS, we digitized and georeferenced historical and current aerial photographs of randomly-selected stands. Ordination analyses revealed striking community-level differences between locust and pine-oak stands in their immediate vicinity. Understory nonnative species richness and abundance values were significantly higher under Robinia stands than under the paired native stands. Additionally, animal-dispersed plant species tended to occur in closer stands, suggesting their spread between locust stands. Robinia stand area significantly decreased from the 1970's to 2002, prompting us to recommend no management action of black locust and a monitoring program and possible removal of associated animal-dispersed species. The introduction of a novel functional type (nitrogen-fixing tree) into this xeric, nutrient-poor, upland forested ecosystem resulted in 'islands of invasion' within this resistant system.",Web of Science,Robinia pseudoacacia,USA,Massachusetts,Cape Cod,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

However, differences in invader life-history traits between populations have received less attention. We conducted a broad geographical analysis (i.e. 1050 km wide transect) of plant traits comparing insular and mainland populations to test the hypothesis that alien plants from insular populations have the potential for higher invasiveness than their alien mainland counterparts. For this purpose plants of the annual geophyte Oxalis pes-caprae were grown from bulbs collected in the Balearic islands and the Spanish mainland under common greenhouse conditions. There were no significant differences in bulb emergence and plant survival between descendants from insular and mainland populations. However, Oxalis descendants from insular populations produced 20% more bulbs without reducing allocation to bulb size, above-ground biomass or flowering than descendants from mainland populations. Based on the lack of sexual reproduction in Oxalis and the dependence of invasion on bulb production, our study suggests that the higher occurrence of Oxalis in the Balearic islands than in the Spanish mainland can partially be explained by genetically based higher propagation potential of insular populations compared to mainland populations.",Web of Science,Oxalis pes-caprae,,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Empty Niche;Community Species Richness,,primary

Little is known, however, about the role of roads in eastern deciduous forest ecosystems where road density is high. Further, it is not known whether the distribution of exotic plants along roads depends on the successional age of the forest. In this study, densities of four of seven exotic shrub species declined with increasing distance to the nearest road across all successional ages. Greater densities of exotic shrubs were found in young and mid-successional forests than mature forests. However, there was no interaction between distance to road and forest age, suggesting that the role of roads in the invasion process does not change across forest successional ages.

This grass has been introduced into North America and now occurs throughout much of the western United States. Within its native range, bulbous bluegrass reproduces mainly through sexual means; however, in North America clonal reproduction occurs primarily through the production of vegetative structures called bulblets. High chromosome counts are frequently reported for this species and suggest it is a polyploid. To assess the level and pattern of genetic diversity of bulbous bluegrass across a portion of its introduced range, a total of 10 populations from Idaho, Oregon, and Washington were analyzed by staining for 14 enzymes that were coded for by 19 genetic loci. Results indicate that bulbous bluegrass contains higher levels of genetic variation than expected for an introduced clonal plant species: 27.9% of loci are polymorphic per population, with an average of 1.54 alleles per locus, and a mean observed heterozygosity of 0.202. On average, 64% of all individuals within these populations possess three or four alleles at one or more loci; a value consistent with previous reports for autopolyploid species. A total of 84 multilocus genotypes were detected in these 10 populations, with an average of 9.6 genotypes per population. The number and complex distribution of multilocus genotypes observed in this study may be the result of multiple introductions of this species into its new range, and/or occasional sexual reproduction within introduced populations.",Web of Science,Pea bulbosa,USA,Idaho; Oregon; Washington,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

A shortage of mutualists could potentially limit the rate of population growth for an invading species. The introduced shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom, Leguminosae) is a pest plant on the west coast of North America. It produces flowers that are ''tripped'' open when pollinated and has a nearly obligatory relationship with resident bumble bees and honey bees. Experiments in the state of Washington showed that <1% of untripped flowers produced fruits and that outcross-pollinated flowers yielded fourfold more fruit than self-pollinated flowers, revealing apparent inbreeding depression. Mean pollinator visitation rate, as determined by the proportion of flowers tripped, varied among three years and among four populations but was low (3-30%) in every case. Two urban populations (Magnuson Park and Discovery Park in Seattle) received higher numbers of visits than two native prairie populations (Johnson Prairie and 13th Division Prairie in southwestern Washington). Hand-pollination experiments revealed significant pollinator limitation in all populations in both 1993 and 1994, with the mean increase in fruit production ranging from 280 to 2620%. Prairie populations were more pollinator limited than urban populations. Resources available for per-flower fruit production appeared to be equally available in all populations in 1993 but more available in prairie populations than in urban populations in 1994. The relationship between natural visitation and proportion fruit set per branch was a saturating curve in 1993 but a linear function in 1994 and 1995. Significant correlations were found between pollinator visitation and variation in whole-plant fruit production in all 3 yr. No evidence was found for either (1) reallocation of resources between branches within a season, or (2) a cost of reproduction between seasons in plants receiving supplemental pollen. Demographic analysis showed that a very large cost of reproduction would be required to counterbalance the increase in fecundity achieved with full pollination. Simulations of new populations invading over a short time scale (10-30 yr) demonstrated little effect of pollen limitation in the slow-growing urban populations, but a potentially large effect of increasing pollinator visitation in the rapidly invading prairie populations.",Web of Science,Cytisus scoparius,USA,Washington,,47.116869,-122.56073,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland;Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

Levels of genetic variation were high, with average heterozygosities per locus ranging from 0.20 to 0.21 for the Australian collections, and from 0.23 to 0,27 for the European collections. The 3 Australian collections were genetically very closely related to one another, with no statistically significant differences at any of the 15 variable loci. This suggests either an introduction to one port, with a subsequent spread to other areas, or separate introductions with subsequent extensive gene flow. The 4 European collections showed limited, but significant, differentiation among themselves at 10 of 18 variable loci. Much of the heterogeneity reflected differences between the Roscoff (Atlantic) collection and the 3 Mediterranean collections. The Roscoff collection was less variable, in terms of both heterozygosity and mean numbers of alleles, than the Mediterranean collections. The Australian collections were more closely related to the Mediterranean collections (mean Nei distance = 0.040) than to the Roscoff collection (mean Nei distance = 0.084). Ii a Mediterranean origin is assumed, then the introduction to Australia was accompanied by the loss of about 18% of the original variation. Finally, the high genetic similarity of the Australian to the European collections of S. spallanzanii, and the very clear genetic separation of S. pavonina (mean Nei distance = 0.996), reaffirms that the Australian collections are truly S. spallanzanii and not an undescribed native species.",Web of Science,Sabella spallanzanii,France; Spain; Australia,,,,,Field - Observational,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Fundamentals,,,filter

Disturbance is widely believed to facilitate invasions by exotic plants, but is also important for the persistence of many native species. Here, I report the results of a series of field experiments designed to investigate the effects of soil disturbance on natives and aliens in Californian grassland vegetation. I also compare the effects of different types of soil disturbance to establish whether some favour aliens to a greater degree than others. 2. In two experiments, conducted at different locations, three types of soil disturbance (excavation, burial and simulated gopher mounds) were created, and their revegetation was compared with changes in undisturbed control plots over the next three years. A third experiment was used to provide data on the effects of soil disturbance on soil temperature, moisture and KCl-extractable nitrogen. 3. Disturbance affected both soil temperature and chemistry. Buried plots contained the most KCl-extractable nitrogen, and were also the warmest. Effects on soil moisture were relatively small. 4. Initially, most disturbances greatly reduced the numerical abundance both of groups dominated by natives (perennial graminoids and bulbs) and of groups dominated by aliens (annual graminoids). Disturbance also reduced maximal (summer) species richness, but in some cases increased the fraction of richness contributed by natives. 5. In subsequent years, richness rebounded as natives and exotics re-invaded. Native bulbs and perennial graminoids were slow to recover; instead, most disturbances sr increasingly became numerically dominated by exotic annual grasses, accentuating the effects of a multi-year drought. 6. The differing effects of experimental disturbances on aliens and natives can best be explained by considering relationships between sources of propagules, life histories and geographical origins. 7. Some types of disturbance were less damaging to native-dominated groups than others, but most ultimately favoured exotics. Consequently, it may be difficult to develop management strategies that preserve the diversity of disturbance-dependent natives while still excluding weedy aliens.",Web of Science,Many,USA,California,,39.0014,-123.0019,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure;Disturbance,,primary

There was a clear contrast between stream stations found within relatively undeveloped watersheds and those in highly developed or farmed drainage areas. Surface waters of the undisturbed sites displayed lower pH and specific conductance values compared with waters in the more disturbed watersheds. The most heavily impacted sites supported a unique group of peripheral or exotic plant species that replaced characteristic Pine Barrens species. Overall species richness did not change in response to watershed disturbance. The presence of disturbance indicator species, or species found only at disturbed sites, provided a good measure of watershed disturbance. High between-site variability in the species present at relatively undisturbed stations and the persistence of some species at more recently disturbed sites complicated the identification of sensitive species, or species found only at undisturbed sites.

A comparative study showed that a native, perennial, high marsh dominant, Salicornia subterminalis, and an invasive, exotic annual grass, Polypogon monspeliensis, responded differently to soil salinity and saturation. Salicornia subterminalis seeds and young plants were more salt tolerant, and the native grew best at high salinities (23 g l(-1) and 34 g l(-1)) in greenhouse experiments. In contrast, the exotic had reduced growth at high salinities relative to nonsaline controls. The native, S. subterminalis, grew poorly as the duration of soil saturation increased from 2 wk to 32 wk, but P. monspeliensis grew equally well for all durations tested. The response of S. subterminalis and P. monspeliensis to increased salinity indicated that salt applications might be used to protect native vegetation in salt marshes where salt-sensitive exotics are a problem. A field experiment verified that a salt application of 850 g m(-2) mo(-1) for 3 mo was sufficient to control the exotic, while not noticeably affecting the native.

Four field seasons after a one-time addition of seed, many added species were still present and reproducing, with plots seeded at the highest rate having species richness that was 83% greater and total plant cover that was 31% greater than controls. Total plant community cover increased significantly with the number of species added as seed, but total cover of pre-existing species was independent of the number of species added as seed, suggesting that the new species mainly filled previously ''empty'' sites. The proportion of added species that became established was negatively correlated with initial species richness of plots, suggesting that species-rich sites were more resistant to invasion. Plot invasibility also depended on the abundances and species richness of plant functional groups in the plots, but was independent of seed size and of total plant cover. The major functional groups of plants differed in their abilities to invade as seed, with perennial grasses being the poorest invaders and herbaceous legumes being the best. Thus, local biotic interactions and recruitment dynamics jointly determined diversity, species composition, and species abundances in these native grassland communities. This supports a metapopulation-like perspective over a purely interspecific-interaction perspective or a purely regional perspective, suggesting that recruitment limitation may be more important, even on a local scale, than often recognized.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Minnesota,Cedar Creek Natural History Area,45.419419,-93.195992,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

In a preference experiment two submerged macrophytes (Chara vulgaris and Elodea canadensis), and both seedlings and established plants of S. lacustris and P. natans, were presented pairwise to signal and noble crayfish. There was no significant difference in preference by the two crayfish species. Chara vulgaris was preferred to all other plants presented, established plants of S. lacustris and P. natans were never preferred, and seedlings of P. natans were preferred to established P. natans. 4. An aquarium experiment was conducted in which the consumption of Chara by signal and noble crayfish was measured in relation to water temperature. Signal crayfish consumed significantly more Chara than noble crayfish, especially at higher temperatures. 5. Our results indicate that the signal crayfish is the more voracious grazer especially at higher temperatures. There may be negative effects on vegetation (emergents and floating-leaved, as well as submerged species) when the signal crayfish is introduced. Chara species are particularly susceptible, since they are preferred by crayfish and the genus includes a large number of rare species. Stocking of crayfish therefore could lead to the decline or removal of submerged species in order of crayfish feeding preferences and could prevent the spread or cause a decline of emergent and floating-leaved vegetation.",Web of Science,Pacifastacus leniusculus,Sweden,,,,,Greenhouse,lentic,,Fundamentals,,,herbivore

Additionally, in comparative seedling growth assays soil cores removed from dense B. orientalis stands were tested bimonthly for elevated allelopathic effects. The impact of root exudates on seedling growth was generally weak and varied between species. Similar results were obtained for the effect of B. orientalis leaf litter leachates on seedlings grown in sand culture relative to the effect of leaf litter leachates of a plant species mixture. When soil as a growth substrate was used, no consistent differences in seedling growth were obtained between the two litter leachate treatments. In the soil core experiment seedlings grown in soil cores collected from a dense B. orientalis stand unexpectedly showed better performance than seedlings grown in soil cores collected from a nearby mixed plant stand without B. orientalis, at least in early spring and late autumn.

At low density, the floating plants produced ten times as many ramets (clonal offshoots) as those at high density.

In early summer there was a highly significant linear relationship between dry mass of nuts and the total mass of ramets that each had produced. In early summer most (73-83%) of the variation in total plant biomass was attributable to variation in initial nut size. However the significance of initial nut size was diminished later in the season. The great success of the exotic weed T. natans at colonizing and monopolizing an aquatic habitat is a function of its highly productive clonal growth response to low-density conditions, combined with greater proportional allocation of biomass to reproductive structures, resulting in greatly increased nut production at low initial density.

The proportions of plant group classified according to life-span, morphology, ruderality and location along the rivers were analysed. Both proportions of plant traits and total species richness differed considerably between rivers. Semi-arid rivers were more influenced by local patterns than the other rivers. The patterns exhibited by true riparian species and invading, essentially non-riparian species, showed the importance of the relationships between the river and its close surroundings. The mean proportion of ruderals remained roughly the same in all rivers, suggesting some regulatory mechanisms independent of the general environmental settings. The longitudinal patterns of species richness in riparian plant communities of the oceanic rivers could be related to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whereas semi-arid rivers showed very irregular patterns of species richness along their courses, as a consequence of the irregular water availability. Exotic and ruderal species were more sensitive than other groups to the longitudinal zonation of the rivers and to environmental factors influenced by humans.

This study was conducted to provide information about the species' biology that might be useful in controlling its spread in native woodlands. The plant is a strict biennial in North America, spending the first year of growth as a basal rosette. This period of relatively slow growth is followed by a period of rapid shoot elongation (1.9 cm/day) during early spring of the second growing season. The plant is capable of cross- and self-pollination, although pollination and stigma receptivity occur before the flower is open, so autogamy is the most likely breeding system. Garlic mustard invests 20.4% of its biomass in reproductive effort, with an annual seed rain of 15,000 seeds/m(2). Seed dispersal from fruits begins in early July and continues into October. Most seeds germinate in the spring following the year in which they were produced. Seedling recruitment is high (8.3-18.0 seedlings/dm(2)), but only about 7.5% of the plants survive to maturity. The success of the plant in invading woodlands appears to be related to (1) its autogamous breeding system that allows a single individual, or a few individuals, to establish populations of genetically similar but interfertile individuals; (2) high seed production, permitting establishment of large numbers of individuals; and (3) rapid growth during the second growing season, which increases its competitive ability.

Positive linear relationships were found between the total number of species and the percentage of aliens observed in each site.

Therefore, it is likely that small biological differences between species interact with habitat characteristics to produce distinct patterns of distribution and abundance throughout a new range. In this study we test the hypothesis that differences in the distribution and abundance of species sharing an identical set of ''ideal weed characteristics'' are explicable in terms of species-specific responses to environmental variation within their new range. Using multifactor experiments, we investigated some of the ecological interactions influencing reproductive success in two very closely related species of annuals having invaded the French Mediterranean region for >150 yr and showing marked differences in their local distribution and abundance patterns. We transplanted seedlings of Conyza canadensis (a species restricted to recently disturbed areas) and C. sumatrensis (a species colonizing early- to mid-successional old fields) at equal densities in three contrasting old fields (6 mo, 4 yr, 17-yr abandonment, respectively) during 1991-1992, a growing season with average rainfall. Individual performances (measured as survivorship, reproductive timing, and reproductive output) were evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbors (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) resource availability (tested with nutrient and water addition), and (3) herbivory (tested with chemical limitation). Manipulated factors interacted in a rather complex fashion to influence survivorship and reproduction in both species. However, patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across Mediterranean landscapes: C. sumatrensis performed better than C. canadensis in all fields, including the youngest one (6 mo old). Herbivory only slightly affected transplant performances. In contrast, competition with plant neighbors had substantial effects on either Conyza species and may be the most important determinant of performance in Mediterranean old fields. The experiment showed unambiguously that the two species differ markedly in their competitive ability, with C. sumatrensis performing better than C. canadensis in the presence of neighboring vegetation. In addition, C. sumatrensis displayed a superior ability to take up and/or to use water and nutrient resources when they become available in competitive environments. We argue that potential physiological or anatomical species differences responsible for this differential susceptibility to local resource reduction by neighbors could involve differences in constructional organization, leaf morphology, and reproductive phenologies.",Web of Science,Conyza canadensis; Conyza sumatrensis,France,,Montpelier,43.65,3.85,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,,primary

Here we present evidence that, within California coastal prairie, invasion also can be facilitated by a native nitrogen-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus). Bush lupines fix nitrogen and grow rapidly, fertilizing the sandy soil with nitrogen-rich litter. The dense lupine canopy blocks light, restricting vegetative growth under bushes. Heavy insect herbivory kills lupines, opening exposed nitrogen-rich sites within the plant community. Eventual re-establishment of lupine occurs because of an abundant and long-lived seed bank. Lupine germination, rapid growth, shading and fertilization of sites, and then death after only a few years, results in a mosaic of nutrient-rich sites that are available to invading species. To determine the role of bush lupine death and nitrogen enrichment in community composition, we examined nutrient dynamics and plant community characteristics within a site only recently colonized by lupine, comparing patches where lupines had recently died or were experimentally killed with adjacent areas lacking lupine. In experimentally killed patches, instantaneous pool sizes of exchangeable ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were higher than in adjacent sites free of lupine. Seedlings of the introduced grass Bromus diandrus accumulated 48% greater root biomass and 93% more shoot biomass when grown in a greenhouse in soil collected under experimentally killed lupines compared to B. diandrus seedlings grown in soil collected at least 1 m away from lupines. At the end of the spring growing season, total above-ground live plant biomass was more than twice as great in dead lupine patches as in the adjacent lupine-free grassland, but dead lupine patches contained 47% fewer plant species and 57% fewer native species. Sites where lupines have repeatedly died and reestablished during recent decades support an interstitial grassland community high in productivity but low in diversity, composed of mostly weedy introduced annual plants. In contrast, at a site only recently colonized by bush lupines, the interstitial grassland consists of a less productive but more diverse set of native and introduced species. We suggest that repeated bouts of lupine germination, establishment, and death can convert a rich native plant community into a less diverse collection of introduced weeds.",Web of Science,Bromus diandrus,,,,38.306979,-123.0655,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

Haleakala (3055 m). Oceanic islands are considered susceptible to biological invasion, and this study numerically tested this circumstantial evidence with the following questions: Are all habitats equally susceptible; and, do successful invaders have wider realized niches than natives? The mountain slope consists of three distinct altitudinal bioclimatic zones (hot moist lowland, wet montane cloud, and cool arid high-altitude zones). Ordination indicated that alien species' ranges and population expansions were clustered in the lowland and high-altitude zones. The lowland zone had been subjected to natural canopy dieback, and the high-altitude zone to grazing by domestic and feral ungulates. By contrast, the montane cloud forest was relatively intact in terms of number and cover of native species. Thus, susceptibility to alien invasion clearly differed among zones, and the primary causes seemed to be the obvious disturbance factors. The mean ecological range along the altitude-rainfall gradient was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for native than for alien species in most life-form groups. The reasons for the greater number of climate generalists among the natives vs. the range-restricted aliens appear to be related to: (1) the pre-alien condition with a depauperate flora which allowed for 'ecological release' of successful native colonizers, and (2) the climatic pre-adaptation of alien invaders which restricts them from penetrating over a broader spectrum of climatic zones in a floristic matrix subjected to increasing interspecific competition.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Hawaii,Mt.

Predation of moulted females occurs both shortly after their release from precopulatory mate-guarding and whilst they are being guarded by their mates. In the present study, two hypotheses concerning the underlying cause(s) of the differential predation pattern are tested. Firstly, female G. d. celticus may be more vulnerable to predation than female G. pulex due to the former being released from precopula guarding with the new exoskeleton in a less hardened state. Secondly, G. pulex may be an inherently more aggressive species than G. d. celticus during predatory interactions over guarded females. The first experiment indicated that differential predation was not mediated by species differences in the state of the female exoskeleton at the time of release from precopula by guarding males. The second experiment, however, showed that male G. pulex were significantly more aggressive than male G. d. celticus in attacking both guarding male congenerics and guarded moulted female congenerics. In addition, in defence against predatory attacks, paired male and female G. pulex were significantly more aggressive than paired male and female G. d. celticus. These differences in aggressive behaviour led to a significantly higher frequency of predation on G. d. celticus females than on G. pulex females, and also explains this finding in previous studies. It is concluded that differential predation due to differences in aggressive behaviour may explain the pattern of replacement between these species.",Web of Science,Gammarus  pulex,Ireland,County Down,River Lagan,,,Field - Experimental,lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,omnivore

Several aspects of the regeneration of these Passiflora species were examined and the results generally reflected those of intensive studies of the same species conducted in Hawaii. Seed germination in the laboratory was continuous over an 8 month period from sowing, and in the wild this allows seeds to accumulate in the soil seed bank. Germinable seeds and seedling numbers, however, were of a similar magnitude to those of native angiosperms at the sites, and they do not reach the very large numbers of some woody weeds. Seedling growth was c. 10 cm over a seven month period at two sites at 300 m a.s.l., which is towards the upper altitudinal limit of Passiflora species. Stem cuttings readily establish in both a glasshouse and a shadehouse. As stems frequently become buried and fragmented on steep slopes, their regeneration may assist in the localised spread of the plant, and also in the re-establishment of plants on a wide range of sites after mechanical control operations. Establishment of Passiflora species is restricted to areas of high light levels and soil disturbance such as forest clearings and road cuttings in the absence of dense herbaceous growth.

Changes in population and life forms density of both native and exotic species were analyzed. Communities were species rich when 45% of the 428 species present in the study area (2-km-long stretch) were found in the 10 x 10 m plots. Most of the species were annuals, but perennials were also abundant. The exotic component represented nearly 20% of the species and of the total number of individuals. There was high spatial variability in pioneer communities; sites of the main river channel differed from those along abandoned arms in species composition and population densities. The communities responded to changes in the hydrology of the preceding growing season. Sharp year to year differences were found in population and species density. The nature of the hydrological change drove those changes. Plots located in the oldest arms of the river showed a greater sensitivity to flooding conditions than those located in young littoral zones, with an increase in hygrophilous species. Alternatively, plots adjacent to active river channels showed greater sensitivity to drought conditions, as the density of short-lived and exotic species increased. Comparatively, exotics appeared to be more sensitive to the type of hydrological changes than natives. Warmer years also affected native plants, which reacted like invasive species.

Erodium cicutarium, Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens, and other Mediterranean annuals were found to constitute a very large proportion of the vegetation on giant kangaroo rat precincts. When vegetation on precincts was compared with the vegetation in less disturbed intermediate areas located between precincts, species richness, cover and frequency of exotic plants were significantly greater on precincts. The reverse was found for native species. In addition, exotic species encountered in this study had significantly larger seeds than did native species, suggesting that these granivorous kangaroo rats preferentially cache large weed seeds on their precincts. Since the kangaroo rats depend on exotic plants for food and the exotic plants depend upon the kangaroo rats to disturb their habitat continually, the weed-kangaroo rat relationship is mutualistic. This strong relationship may also inhibit population growth of native grassland plants which occupy disturbed habitats but have difficulty competing with exotic weeds for resources.

Alien vegetation and animals have invaded the eastern Washington region in the past century and are currently represented in the Columbia River Plain. Investigations were undertaken to evaluate the distribution of alien species, particularly vegetation, and their relationships to other flora and fauna in this region. Recently disturbed areas were dominated by the alien annuals Russian thistle Salsola kali, tumble mustard Sisymbrium altissimum, prickly lettuce Lactuca serriola, and bur ragweed Ambrosia acanthicarpa.

Cheat-grass and spring whitlow-grass Draba verna were able to set seed in undisturbed habitats, whereas Russian thistle and tumble mustard seldom did.

Old-field habitats support a depauperate fauna compared to undisturbed sagebrush steppe vegetation. Shrub-nesting birds such as the sage sparrow Amphispiza belli were absent from old fields, and even ground-nesting species were found in abnormally low densities. Old fields supported relatively few mammal species, in part as a result of poor food supplies.

Also, parasitoid complexes on hosts as invaders are generally less rich and contain a higher proportion of generalists than those on hosts as natives. Overall richness shows a weak tendency to increase with duration in the region of introduction over the first 150 yr, but the ratio of generalists-to specialists does not change over this time period.

No strong influences emerged. Our most novel result is a vulnerability-to-parasitism regression; the numbers of parasitoids attacking host species in invaded regions are correlated with the numbers in native regions.

The distribution of two exotic species, Melilotus alba (white sweetclover) and Daucus carota (Queen Anne's lace), and seven native species, Potentilla arguta (prairie cinquefoil), Pedicularis canadensis (Canada lousewort), Dodecatheon meadia (Mead's shooting star), Equisetum laevigatum (scouring rush), Pycnanthemum virginianum (Virginia mountain mint), Phlox glaberrima (smooth phlox) and Solidago graminifolia (bushy goldenrod), were studied in 100, 4 m2 quadrats on five transects. Plant densities and soil characteristics were recorded for each quadrat and analyzed using nonparametric comparison of means and Spearman correlation analysis. Densities of the two exotic species were positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with those of five of the seven natives. Most species exhibited a clear segregation between disturbed and undisturbed transects; Melilotus and Daucus dominated the disturbed transects, and native species dominated the undisturbed transects. Edaphic conditions appear to be the most important factor driving this habitat segregation between exotics and natives. Our finding is instructive for prairie restoration, because it suggests that in some cases, soil restoration may be desirable even if it results in additional mechanical disturbance.

Still, ecologists have a poor understanding of how details of the disturbance regime influence the success with which invaders spread through a community. In this paper, we report results from an experiment that investigates how the spatial distribution of bare ground influences the rate at which offspring of an introduced invader spread through a perennial ryegrass community. Artificially created gaps of three sizes were positioned along linear transects according to one of two spatial distributions. These six transects (one for each treatment combination) were positioned as spokes on a wheel and Senecio vulgaris was introduced into the center. After controlling for the total amount of gap area, we monitored the number ard position of Senecio vulgaris establishing for two subsequent generations. Our results showed that the rate of spread of Senecio vulgaris was sensitive to both the gap size and the gap distribution; plants moved a greater distance when the gaps were large and underdispersed. Simulation models confirm that this pattern follows from the way in which gaps sample from seed shadows. We derive an analytical expression to explain why the mean seed dispersal distance does not predict the spread of Senecio vulgaris adults, and show how rates of spatial spread will change under different spatial patterns of disturbance. Finally, a model of spatial point processes confirms that the distribution of gaps mediates the rate of weed spread in two dimensions as well.",Web of Science,Senecio vulgaris,England,Berkshire,Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Each bract subtends a series of individual, stiff, upright, large flowers which appear every 2.3 days, the total number of flowers being variable (up to 29). The slightly musty sweet smelling, creamy white hermaphrodite flowers, sometimes protogynous, opened at night (82.6% of flowers observed). Anthesis lasted, on average, 1.3 days and stigmas were receptive within the 24 hours of flower opening. Initially, nectar production was copious (1400 mul 12 hr-1) and concentration moderate (14.5% sucrose equivalents), but maximum production (1600 mul 12 hr-1) with slightly reduced concentration (12.5% sucrose) occurred at 2400 hr.

This study was designed to determine mechanisms controlling invasion by this species into three different communities: coastal grassland, backdune, and coastal scrub. The communities differed in several factors that influenced invasion by Carpobrotus: soil disturbance, herbivory, and identity of competitors. Disturbance of the soil was required for establishment of Carpobrotus at the grassland site. Soil disturbance did not promote Carpobrotus establishment in the coastal scrub or backdune. Establishment in these sites was restricted by herbivory. The influence of neighboring vegetation on Carpobrotus establishment was site dependent. At the grassland site, Carpobrotus seedling survival was reduced by grasses, and the only surviving seedlings were on gopher mounds. Growth of larger Carpobrotus plants, however, was unaffected by grasses. Proximity to shrubs, the dominant plant type at the backdune and coastal scrub sites, did not affect Carpobrotus seedling survival. It did, however, decrease both root and shoot biomass of seedlings and cuttings. Invasion is expected to occur most rapidly at the grassland site. Although germination and early survival there depend on the occurrence of rodent disturbances, these occur frequently, and seedling recruitment in the grassland was observed during this study. Once established, clonal growth is great and is not affected by herbivory or competition. In contrast, at the coastal scrub site, intense herbivory prevented successful establishment during this study. Cage experiments suggested that herbivory counteracted the high growth potential of Carpobrotus at this site. At the dune site, even caged plants showed very poor growth. Thus, although seedling recruitment does occur there, invasion is expected to be slow due to harsh physical conditions that limit both survival and growth.

At both sites, there were significant differences among subpopulations in allele frequencies, but these differences were distributed in a patchy fashion and were not correlated with the apparent soil moisture gradients. The degree of genetic subdivision differed between the two sites. At one site, gene flow appeared to be high and differences in allele frequencies are attributed to selection in a mosaic environment. At the other site, gene flow appeared more restricted and differences in allele frequencies between subpopulations are attributed to selection and limited gene flow acting simultaneously. Overall, 15% of the genetic variability is between subpopulations and gene flow is high, even between subpopulations separated by up to 1.5 km, but local conditions can apparently limit gene flow and increase the degree of genetic subdivision.

A previous study failed to demonstrate the occurrence of morphologically differentiated ecotypes among populations of the species but suggested the existence of nutritional ecotypes. This latter possibility is examined here by comparing the ability of plants from contrasting habitats to control cation accumulation balance. Dittrichia viscosa plants. from eight siliceous habitats and nine calcareous habitats of southern France and neighbouring Spain and Italy, were cloned and grown together hydroponically with a solution simulating an acid soil with an aluminium constraint. Two independent hydroponic units containing solution supplemented with two levels of Al were used (2 Al levels x 17 populations x 3 genotypes x 3 replicates). The growth and cation content (K, Ca, Mg and Na) of plant shoots and the chemical composition of the soil of each habitat were analysed. At the high Al level (1.1 mM), populations differed in K, Ca and Mg plant proportions. Two groups could be distinguished: one containing all but one siliceous populations and the other containing all but one calcareous populations. Plants of the siliceous group accumulated proportionally more K and less Ca. and had better growth, than plants of the calcareous group, in the same way as calcifuge and calcicole species when grown on acid soil. At the lowest Al level (0.37 mM), differences between siliceous and calcareous populations were less marked. The results suggest that differences in the ability of plants to control K and Ca balance, which appear to be of adaptive significance, could have arisen through selection, and that Dittrichia viscosa has evolved calcifuge and calcicole nutritional ecotypes in siliceous and calcareous habitats respectively. Various degrees of calcifugy, and to a lesser extent of calcicoly, can thus be suggested to occur among the studied populations, some in relation to the intensity of mineral stress in the natural habitats.

The changes in spatial patterns brought about by the ants were greater when a higher proportion of seeds was removed but were independent of initial seed density. These spatial changes and differences in seed density were examined for their effects on plant size and reproduction. Gini values were calculated to determine inequalities. As the inequality in space among individual plants increased, the variation in final biomass increased. The number of individuals reproducing was constant among treatments, and yet seed production per plant was significantly greater for populations in which the spatial pattern was influenced by seed predation. The decrease in density and changed spatial pattern, due to previous seed predation, resulted in a few individuals having much more space than others and consequently producing many more seeds. The increase in reproductive effort per flat was much greater than could be explained by the changing density alone. Our experiment demonstrates that spatial inequality, such as that generated by seed predators, can be more important than density in generating size inequalities in plant populations.

We consider expansions of pines in and adjacent to their natural ranges in the Northern Hemisphere and the spread from sites of introduction in the Southern Hemisphere well outside the contemporary range of pines. We first consider a neutral hypothesis (with respect to climate or biological interactions as determinants of invasion): invasion simply requires that a species is present in sufficient numbers, with sufficient propagules over sufficient time to invade. We then explore the relative importance of climatic changes. disturbance, competition (including competition between seedlings and herbaceous plants during early establishment), herbivory, pathogens, and other agents that might influence pine membership in communities. Determinants of susceptibility to invasion often interact in a complex fashion. Environmental stresses created by moisture and temperature appear to exercise primary control on invasibility at xeric and high-elevation sites, respectively, but play a smaller role at intermediate locations. At these sites, range limits are determined principally by interactions between pine seedlings and the resident biota in adjacent communities. This suggests that the effects of predicted global warming on the distribution of pines are unlikely to be simple functions of temperature or precipitation. except at climatic extremes. Pine invasions are most prevalent where there is limited competition in the regeneration niche and occur more easily in habitats where the dominant growth form is most different from that of pines, namely, in grasslands. The disturbance regime in the receiving habitat is important and interacts directly and indirectly with the *inherent* susceptibility to invasion. Severe disturbances may initiate pine invasions at any latitude, but are essential for reducing the cover of vigorous plant growth (and hence competition in the regeneration niche) in tropical and near-tropical regions. Contemporary practices such as deforestation and increased grazing pressure and those practices leading to accelerated erosion, modified fire regimes, and climate amelioration essentially duplicate ice-age stresses and disturbances that shaped plant communities in the Holocene.

One hundred and six introduced species have been recorded at Churchill.  Fiftyfive percent of these were *temporary,* dying out when original colonizers senesced (e.g., Avena spp., Setaria viridis).  Seventeen percent were *established,* i.e., able to set viable seed and maintain their populations (e.g., Thlaspi arvense, Crepis tectorum).  Twenty-eight percent *persisted* locally by vegetative propagation or repeated seed input (e.g., Linaria vulgaris, Chenopodium album s.l.).  The findings were compared with those of an earlier study.  The number of species and their local distributions around Churchill have increased in the last 30 years.  This may be due to an increase and diversification in the traffic with southern regions or to an amelioration in the climate.  Although one in five species in the vicinity of Churchill are introduced, usually fewer than 12 weed species were established at any one site.  Abandoned sites exhibited a rapid disappearance of weeds.  Depauperate individuals of a few species were found away from inhabited areas, with none occurring in natural communities.  Organic material in refuse tips provided a mild environment with a long growing season.  Refuse tips may act as refuges for weeds and as potential sources of their seeds.  Aliens that were successful at seed product on were either perennials, winter annuals, or biennials.  These plants flowered early and hence are able to ripen their seeds.  Years with long growing seasons may allow seed production in otherwise temporary species.  Dynamics of weedy species around Churchill will likely reflect current and (or) future events in other, more isolated northern communities.",Web of Science,Many,Canada,Manitoba,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Fundamentals,,,primary

An ordination of the sites showed that the major directions of variation in the vegetation were associated with altitude and soil moisture.  Calluna had increased in extent since the area was mapped in 1960, and has been observed to have increased further since this survey was completed in 1984.  Calluna has a potential to spread in all the recognised communities, although increases have been greatest in tussock grassland and on disturbed ground at lower altitudes and least in boggy areas.  Calluna thus remains a threat to the natural vegetation of the Park, although some areas may be equally liable to succeed to taller vegetation.

Experimental nest boxes provided were never used for nesting.  Marine debris was not used as nest substrate on Laysan Island.  In contrast, the introduced Laysan Finch populations on four islands at Pearl and Hermes Reef used a wide variety of native and alien plants as nest substrates, as well as various kinds of human-made debris.  However, nest boxes provided at Pearl and Hermes Reef were not used as nest substrates by finches.  Eragrostis variabilis is uncommon on Pearl and Hermes Reef, except on Seal-Kittery Island, but is common on Laysan where it is the preferred nest substrate.  Eragrostis is a dense bunchgrass which probably provides the nest with good protection from sun, rain, wind, disturbance, and predators.  On Pearl and Hermes Reef, where Eragrostis variabilis is uncommon, other plants that provide dense cover are used as nest substrates, and human-made debris that provides some cover is also utilized.  It is unclear why nest boxes were never used as nest substrates at either site.  We suggest that the conservation of Laysan Finches on Laysan Island will require the maintenance of a native ecosystem where Eragrostis variabilis is a major vegetation component.  Otherwise, changes in behavior, morphology, and energy expenditure associated with environmental differences are likely to occur, and may have already occurred in the introduced populations on Pearl and Hermes Reef.",Web of Science,Telespiza cantans,United States,Hawaii,,,,Field - Experimental;Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Fundamentals,,,omnivore

One of these species, Echinochloa pyramidalis, has been introduced in the freshwater wetlands of the Mexican tropics. This alien species reduces biodiversity by replacing native species. The removal of non-indigenous species from invaded communities often requires different techniques such as physical, chemical, or biological controls. We evaluated the effects of mechanical (cutting or soil-disking) and chemical (spraying Round Up (TM) herbicide) disturbance treatments on the plant community of a freshwater marsh invaded by E. pyramidalis. We predicted that intense disturbance would eliminate this African grass from the experimental plots. Over a nine-month period, we analyzed species cover, richness, and diversity in experimental plots that received different disturbance treatments. Also, we measured the aerial biomass at the end of the experiment. The treatment that best reduced the dominance of E. pyramidalis and increased the diversity of native species was soil disking, but this was not enough to eliminate the grass. After nine months, E. pyramidalis recovered in all the treatments and again became the dominant species. To eliminate this species completely, it is necessary to recreate the natural topography and hydrology of the wetland and to select control mechanisms that disrupt those growth characteristics (e.g., rapid propagation from rhizomes and horizontal expansion via tillers) that make this grass more competitive than native species.",Web of Science,Echinochloa pyramidalis,Mexico,,,19.6,-96.3778,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Wetland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

In this paper we analyse the morphological and functional traits of coastal dune wild species (natives and aliens) based mainly on information from the literature. The most common 130 wild species occurring on the recent (Holocenic) coastal dunes were included considering the invasive status of alien plants. A comparative analysis of functional groups was performed through ordination techniques (PCoA using the Gower index). This reveals four functional groups related to the most important plant communities in coastal vegetation zonation. Alien plants were found in all functional groups and no trait or set of traits was specifically related to them. This indicates that aliens show similar traits to those natives growing in different communities of the coastal dune zonation, from the small beach annuals to the evergreen taller shrubs of the Mediterranean macchia. When the invasive status of alien species was taken into account, however, some differences emerged: a) casual aliens were found in almost all groups but their traits were not interpreted as being due to any particular adaptive strategy; b) naturalised aliens were only found in the less fluctuating habitats of the inner coastal zones; c) invasive alien species were connected with two major plant strategies: annual invasive aliens (quick-to-mature low grasses and herbs) and perennial invasive aliens (taller and often strongly clonal).",Web of Science,Many,Italy,Lazio; Molise,,41.43,13.3,Statistical/Meta-analysis;Review,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Rapid Growth;Clonal Reproduction,primary

We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20 degrees C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 +/- 7,296 eggs (mean standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range.",Web of Science,Rana catesbeiana,Canada,British Columbia,Victoria,48,-123,Field - Observational,lentic,Pelagic/Open Ocean,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,predator

A central unanswered question of invasion ecology is why some introduced populations establish while most fail. Answering this question will allow resource managers to increase the specificity and effectiveness of control efforts and policy. We studied the establishment of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) in the United States and Canada by modeling introduction failure caused by demographic stochasticity, environmental variation, and seasonal environmental forcing. We compared predicted establishment rates with observed invasions of inland lakes in Ontario, Canada. Our findings suggest that environmental forcing can cause *windows* of invasion opportunity so that timing of introductions might be a greater determinant of population establishment than demographic stochasticity and random environmental variation. We expect this phenomenon to be exhibited by species representing a wide range of life histories. For spiny water flea in North America, a large window of invasion opportunity opens around the fourth week of May, persists through the summer, and closes with decreasing water temperatures in autumn. These results show how timing of introductions with respect to seasonally forced environmental drivers can be a key determinant of establishment success.

Growth of juveniles and adult survival of invasive species are key factors in invasion process. Life-history traits that increase juvenile fitness including increased rates of development and behavioral characteristics that facilitate competitive success such as increased predator efficiency and foraging ability may explain invasiveness of a species. Invasion of Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in North America provides an opportunity to investigate life-history traits of juveniles of an invasive species. Here, we evaluate both developmental and behavioral traits that may explain the success of H. axyridis by comparing it to an ecologically similar indigenous species Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Three points may contribute to the invasiveness of H. axyridis. First, development of H. axyridis was faster during the 2nd larval instar than C. maculata, a characteristic that may reduce vulnerability at young instars. Second, H. axyridis reached the 4th instar more rapidly than C. maculata. The 4th instar of H. axyridis was also characterized by higher predation efficiency with increased voracity, lethal contact and search efficiency of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum. Finally, surprisingly, a 5th larval instar occured in 33% of the individuals of H. axyridis and was characterized by the same developmental time, but with increased voracity and weight gain compared to 4th larval instars, suggesting an increased fitness of these individuals.

Dispersal patterns can be affected by characteristics of the parent plant and by climatic or site characteristics, including community vegetation structure, but these factors have not been studied in the context of plant invasion processes. Cynara cardunculus (L.) is a polycarpic perennial thistle invasive in coastal grasslands in California that produces large numbers of wind-dispersed seeds. This study quantified and compared C. cardunculus dispersal patterns in an exotic grassland (vegetated site) and an agricultural field (non-vegetated site). Seed size variation in C. cardunculus was also quantified within inflorescences, between inflorescences, and between years of production, and compared across dispersal distances. Results indicate that dispersal distance increased dramatically from less than 20 m in the vegetated site to more than 40 m in the non-vegetated site. Plants producing fewer seeds produced heavier seeds and dispersal distance decreased over time, but seed size was not related to dispersal distance, which may serve to spread the risk to seeds or seedlings across the environment. C. cardunculus has great potential for dispersal in open areas such as agricultural fields or disturbed sites, but may be limited in highly structured natural communities. Management of C. cardunculus and other wind-dispersed plant invasions may be improved by prioritizing populations with open or disturbed areas downwind and minimizing the removal of vegetation during dispersal.",Web of Science,Cynara cardunculus,United States,California,Crystal Cove State Park,33.585351,-117.802134,Field - Experimental;Garden,terrestrial,Grassland,Fundamentals,,,primary

Because these habitats require some form of disturbance to maintain them, they may be especially vulnerable to exotic plant invasions. We examined the vulnerability to invasion of 44 early successional sites in southeastern New Hampshire using a two-tiered approach. Colonization (Tier 1, based on presence/absence) and establishment and spread (Tier 2, based on percent coverage of an occupied site) of invasive shrubs among patches of early successional habitat were related to landscape and local habitat features. Landscape elements (e.g., amount of disturbed lands within I km of the invaded patch) and features described at a local scale (e.g., soil pH and clay content) were associated with colonization, whereas spread of invasive shrubs at a patch of early successional habitat was described exclusively by local features. Prevalence of agricultural fields (historic and present day) was the most influential feature affecting both colonization and spread of invasive shrubs. Results of this study provided an approach for identifying early successional habitats that may be especially prone to exotic shrub invasions. Although our models explained only a portion of the vulnerability of a site to invasion, we suggest that an evaluation of factors that operate at different spatial scales provided new insight on the habitat characteristics that influence the range expansion of invasive plants.

Native Populus forests have declined, while the exotic Eurasian shrub, Tamarix, has proliferated and now dominates most floodplain ecosystems. Photographs from late 19th and early 20th centuries illustrate wide river channels with largely bare in-channel landforms and shrubby higher channel margin floodplains. However, by the mid-20th century, floodplains supporting dense Tamarix stands had expanded, and river channels had narrowed. Along the lower Green River in eastern Utah, the causal mechanism of channel and floodplain changes remains ambiguous due to the confounding effects of climatically driven reductions in flood magnitude, river regulation by Flaming Gorge Dam, and Tamanix invasion. This study addressed whether Tamarix establishment and spread followed climate- or dam-induced reductions in annual peak flows or whether Tamarix was potentially a driver of floodplain changes. We aged 235 Tamarix and 57 Populus individuals, determined the hydrologic and geomorphic processes that controlled recruitment, identified the spatial relationships of germination sites within floodplain stratigraphic transects, and mapped woody riparian vegetation cohorts along three segments of the lower Green River. The oldest Tamarix established along several sampling reaches in 1938, and 1.50-2.25 in of alluvium has accreted above their germination surfaces. Nearly 90% of the Tamarix and Populus samples established during flood years that exceeded the 2.5-year recurrence interval. Recruitment was most common when large floods were followed by years with smaller peak flows. The majority of Tamarix establishment and Green River channel narrowing occurred long before river regulation by Flaming Gorge Dam. Tamarix initially colonized bare instream sand deposits (e.g., islands and bars), and most channel and floodplain changes followed the establishment of Tamarix. Our results suggest that Tamarix recruitment was triggered by large annual floods that were followed by years with lower peak flows, not by periods of low flow alone. Tamarix appears to have actively invaded floodplains, while Populus colonization has been limited.

When the population density of a weed increases, fast-tracked and appropriate control management strategies are required. The objectives of this study were to: (i) examine the population and soil seed bank dynamics of Nicotiana glauca; (ii) compare the germination patterns of invasive N. glauca seeds collected from two states in Australia, and (iii) investigate the impact of a flood in September 1997 and subsequent drought on N. glauca seedlings. The density of N. glauca followed a steep positive increment during the sampling time (September 1999 to October 2004). The increment pattern was similar in flooded fenced and unfenced plots. Plant density increased over much of the observation period, but had declined to 80 and 432 stems ha(-1), respectively, by October 2004. Stem density recorded in October 2004 along two transects radiating from the central point of the newly created lake demonstrated that a significant number of stems appeared to be dead. A soil seed bank study revealed that seed density varied significantly (p = 0.0001) between flooded fenced (598.75 +/- 71) and flooded unfenced (327.5 +/- 66) plots. In contrast, no N. glauca seedlings were recruited from-the soil collected from the control plots. Germination trials were undertaken on N. glauca seed collected from New South Wales. There was no significance difference detected between treatments light and temperature. Similarly, no interaction was found between light and temperature. A comparative study on seed germination patterns of N. glauca seeds collected from Ivanhoe, New South Wales, and the Flinders Ranges, South Australia, showed that temperature had a significant effect on N. glauca seed germination. The effect varied significantly with main variables (state, length and time) and also with different interactions, except state x light (P = 0.3840). N. glauca seedlings exposed to flood were found to withstand partial flooding for at least 58 days. Under waterlogged conditions, the seedlings showed stem hypertrophy and produced adventitious roots. Only one seedling was found dead in the drought treatment. In conclusion, it is clear that N. glauca invaded the area after a rare flood event and began to function as a casual weed. Established seedlings in the field can withstand extreme ecological events such as flood and drought. Understanding the plants' ecological characteristics through a study such as this at an early rather than late stage in the invasion will help us to take appropriate control measures for this species.

As predicted, unmanipulated plants in the native range (Hungary, Europe) experienced greater herbivore damage than plants in the introduced range (Massachusetts and Connecticut, USA), providing evidence for enemy release, particularly in the first year of growth. Nevertheless, European populations had consistently larger individuals than US populations (rosettes were, for example, eightfold larger) and also had greater reproductive output, but US plants produced larger seeds at a given plant height. Moreover, flowering plants showed significant differences in concentrations of sinigrin in the invasive versus native range, although the direction of the difference was variable, suggesting the influence of environmental effects.

In this study, we have outlined some biochemical traits that may be linked to the spread of this invasive native clonal grass. Plants were collected at the west part of the bay (Le Vivier sur mer) along the salt marsh zonation, some of them were grown further in a glasshouse under different NaCl concentrations and nitrogen sources while others were analysed immediately without treatment. The plants collected from the bay and those treated under controlled conditions were sampled according to different vegetative organs, frozen dried, and water soluble compounds extracted. Potassium and sodium contents were measured by flam photometry and amino acids and betaine through HPLC procedure analysis. It is shown that sodium accumulation and amino acid profiles depend both on the location of the plant on the salt marsh and on the plant organ. We have also highlighted an effect of the nitrogen source (no N, N-NO3- or N-NH4+) on plant response to salt treatment.

(Asteraceae, spotted knapweed) was introduced to the United States from Eurasia in the late 1800s and now covers over 3 million ha in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Several recent studies have suggested that the success of C. maculosa may be partly due to its ability to outcompete native species for phosphorus (P), through high root mass and/ or association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We used a combination of field and greenhouse studies to explore the P efficiency of C maculosa and its effects on soil P levels. C maculosa was P efficient in both the field study and greenhouse experiment. In the field, P concentration in C maculosa was more than twice that of three native species (Pseudorogneria spicata, Festuca idahoensis, and Lupinus sericeous). In the greenhouse experiment, even at extremely low levels of soil P availability, uptake of P by C maculosa was six times greater than that by the native, Lupinus argenteus. However, soil P levels were elevated in sites invaded by C. maculosa, which is the opposite of what would be expected if root or mycorrhizal uptake were responsible for the higher P efficiency. These results indicate that the success of C maculosa may be due to its greater ability to acquire P than native species, but do not indicate that C maculosa is actually outcompeting natives for the P that it acquires. In contrast, C. maculosa appears to have the ability to increase the availability of P in some soils. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Plants were grown for I I weeks, with or without AM, prior to simulated herbivory. We removed 75% of aboveground biomass from half of the plants, and harvested all plants 4 weeks later. All species increased their growth rate after clipping, but clipped plants were smaller than unclipped plants. The difference in biomass between clipped and unclipped plants was smaller for C maculosa (clipped: unclipped = 0.62) than for the native grasses (0.42 and 0.52). Plants with AM were smaller than non-AM plants across all species, with the greatest reduction in F idahoensis (77% versus 18% in C maculosa and P. spicata). Levels of AM colonization were minimal in F idahoensis (< 1% of root length colonized), intermediate in P. spicata (13% colonization) and highest in C maculosa (20%). Extra radical hyphae (ERH) lengths were highest for C. maculosa, and equal between the two grasses. Because of the lower biomass, plant tissue N concentrations were higher in AM plants, but P concentrations increased in AM plants for only C. maculosa and P. spicata. The superior competitive ability of C. maculosa may be the result of greater compensatory growth after herbivory and higher amounts of ERH, both of which result in greater resource capture.

Although existing weed management techniques can successfully reduce negative impacts of knapweeds, these plants continue to spread in an unpredictable manner. The successful spread of knapweeds into native plant communities may be driven, in part, by interactions between these plants and native soil communities. This study was conducted to evaluate the relative benefit of native soil communities to two native plants and two knapweeds and to investigate the growth of these plants in soil from knapweed infestations and from adjacent native rangelands. Individual plants of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Love), yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), spotted and diffuse knapweed were grown in a greenhouse in field collected soil. The relative benefit of the native soil community was determined by comparing emergence and production of native plants and exotic knapweeds in autoclaved versus unautoclaved native rangeland soil. Emergence and production were also determined in the greenhouse for native plants and exotic knapweeds grown in soil collected from the core and perimeter of knapweed infestations and in soil from the adjacent, uninvaded native rangeland. The native soil community had a negative effect on the growth of bluebunch wheatgrass (P spicata (Pursh) A. Love) and diffuse knapweed, but a positive effect on spotted knapweed emergence. The interactions between yarrow (A. millefolium L.) and the native soil community were variable. The native soil community appears to be more beneficial to spotted knapweed than to the other plants studied, including diffuse knapweed. Therefore, it appears that two closely related knapweeds have very different interactions with soil biota and perhaps different strategies for invasion. Soil from diffuse and spotted knapweed infestations did not prevent growth of two native plants. Diffuse knapweed growth was not promoted by soil from within a diffuse knapweed infestation, but soil from the core of a spotted knapweed infestation did increase emergence of spotted knapweed.

Elaiosomes are small nutrient-rich nodes produced on seeds of some plants. Ants collect and disperse elaiosome-bearing seeds, later consuming the elaiosome, but usually discarding the seed intact away from the parent plant. The seeds of C. maculosa possess elaiosomes, suggesting that the dispersal of its seeds and its ability to rapidly spread into native habitats may be enhanced by myrmecochory. We tested for myrmecochory at two Palouse prairie sites in Montana by presenting seeds of C. maculosa and two native dominants, Balsamor-hiza sagittata (a forb) and Psuedoroegneria spicata (a bunchgrass). Seeds were presented in choice (seeds of all three plants) and no choice (seeds of only one plant) treatments. At both study sites, ants readily dispersed the seeds of the invasive plant, C. maculosa, while ignoring seeds of the native plants, B. sagittata and P. spicata. In addition, myrmecochory was not influenced when all three seed types were presented together. Different ant species were observed removing seeds from stations at each site, indicating that myrmecochory of C. maculosa seeds is not restricted to one ant species but rather may be a generalized response across ant communities.

We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges. Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R-2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R-2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R-2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R-2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion. Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion.

Until recently, dominance has been largely overlooked as a significant component of invasion. Therefore, we re-examined a 6-year data set of 323 0.1 ha plots within 18 vegetation types collected in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument from 1998 to 2003, including dominance (i.e. relative cover) in our analyses. We specifically focused on the non-native species Bromus tectorum, a notable dominant annual grass in this system. We found that non-native species establishment and dominance are both occurring in species-rich, mesic vegetation types. Therefore, non-native species dominance may result despite many equally abundant native species rather than a dominant few, and competitive exclusion does not seem to be a primary control on either non-native species establishment or dominance in this study. Unlike patterns observed for non-native species establishment, relative non-native species cover could not be predicted by native species richness across vegetation types (R-2 < 0.001; P = 0.45). However, non-native species richness was found to be positively correlated with relative non-native species cover and relative B. tectorum cover (R-2 = 0.46, P < 0.01; R-2 = 0.17, P < 0.01). Analyses within vegetation types revealed predominantly positive relationships among these variables for the correlations that were significant. Regression tree analyses across vegetation types that included additional biotic and abiotic variables were a little better at predicting non-native species dominance (PRE = 0.49) and B. tectorum dominance (PRE = 0.39) than at predicting establishment.

We used two pre-existing data sets to analyse patterns of invasion by non-native plant species into burnt areas along gradients of topography, soil and vegetation structure in Yosemite National Park, California, USA. A total of 46 non-native species (all herbaceous) were recorded in the two data sets. They occurred in all seven of the major plant formations in the park, but were least common in subalpine and upper montane conifer forests. There was no significant difference in species richness or cover of non-natives between burnt and unburnt areas for either data set, and environmental gradients had a stronger effect on patterns of non-native species distribution, abundance and species composition than burning. Cover and species richness of non-natives had significant positive correlations with slope (steepness) and herbaceous cover, while species richness had significant negative correlations with elevation, the number of years post-burn, and cover of woody vegetation. Non-native species comprised a relatively minor component of the vegetation in both burnt and unburnt areas in Yosemite (percentage species = 4%, mean cover < 6.0%), and those species that did occur in burnt areas tended not to persist over time. The results indicate that in many western montane ecosystems, fire alone will not necessarily result in increased rates of invasion into burnt areas. However, it would be premature to conclude that non-native species could not affect post-fire succession patterns in these systems. Short fire-return intervals and high fire severity coupled with increased propagule pressure from areas used heavily by humans could still lead to high rates of invasion, establishment and spread even in highly protected areas such as Yosemite.",Web of Science,Many,United States,California,,37.4833,-119.2167,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Coniferous Forest;Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Perennial woody invaders often form persistent patches that significantly alter the structure and composition of native plant communities. Given their long generation times compared with ruderal invaders, these species may experience prolonged establishment phases between successful introduction and spread. Gap dynamics of shade-tolerant invaders could lead to multiple lag phases during the invasion process. 2. In order to investigate the potential for long or multiple lag phases, we reconstructed the invasion of Acer platanoides (a shade-tolerant, invasive, exotic tree) on an 1130-ha temperate forested island in Lake Huron, USA. We measured and mapped the spatial location of every A. platanoides >= 0.5 m in height that had successfully established within a 728-ha forested park on the island. A simple age-diameter relationship, developed from a randomly selected subsample of the population, was used to assign an establishment date to each individual. 3. Following a 34-year establishment phase, the area occupied by >= 1 A. platanoides ha(-1) increased linearly at a rate of 5.6 ha year(-1) for 35 years, after which range expansion slowed. Population growth lagged behind range expansion, with rapid population growth associated with infill between parents. During the expansion phase, numerous satellite populations established but contributed little to population growth and spatial expansion because of the long time required for them to become reproductive. These satellite populations will most probably accelerate population growth and spread once they reach reproductive age. 4. Roads and trails provided important corridors for propagule movement away from developed areas over the course of the invasion. They also appeared to facilitate longer distance dispersals than would be expected given the biology of the species. 6. Synthesis and application. Our results suggest that shade-tolerant invaders with long generation times may undergo long establishment phases as well as periodic lags during the expansion phase. These lags may provide windows of opportunity for control but could easily be misinterpreted as signs that the population has reached an equilibrium density or the geographical extent of its spread. Additionally, roads and trails may provide important corridors for movement of propagules via non-standard means of dispersal.",Web of Science,Acer platanoides,United States,Michigan,Mackinac Island,45.85,-84.6167,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Coniferous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Spatial and temporal variation in temperature and salinity and the relative frequencies of these mussel taxa were examined between 2000 and 2004 at four sites in San Francisco Bay and four in Monterey Bay, which were chosen for their different positions along inferred estuarine/oceanic gradients in the hybrid zone. Mussels were genetically identified as the parent species or hybrids by amplifying regions of two species-specific loci: the adhesive byssal thread protein (Glu-5') and the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (ITS 1). The proportion of M. trossulus at the eight hybrid zone sites correlated negatively with average salinity (R-2=0.60) and positively with maximal temperature (R-2 >= 0.72), a somewhat unexpected result given what is known about the phylogeography of this species.

Within Monterey and San Francisco Bays, however, the temporal comparisons (1990s vs. 2000s) revealed abrupt changes in the proportions of the two parent species and their hybrids on annual and decadal time scales.

Reduction and/or growth in germination and growth of the target plant species in the presence of both aqueous and ethanolic extracts at different concentrations indicated that the responses were species-specific and concentration-dependent. Generally, ethanolic extracts (especially from leaves) imposed stronger effects on both seed germination and seedling growth. Extracts with lower concentration at 0.001 g/ml dw could stimulate the seedling growth of rape and morning glory, whereas extracts at any given concentrations have inhibitory effects on wheat and mulberry.

Roadsides may serve merely as habitat for a species spreading independently of roads.

We describe a demographic model of the roadxspecies interaction and suggest methods of assessing conduit function in the field based on the model results. A species limited to roadside habitat will be constrained to spread along the road axis unless its long-range dispersal is sufficient to carry it across the intervening unfavorable area to another road. It will propagate along a road corridor at a rate determined by the scale of short-range dispersal. Effective management of an invasion requires distinguishing between the habitat and conduit functions, a distinction difficult to make with only snapshot data. Invasions can be reconstructed by several methods, but none is totally satisfactory.

The invasive success of M. galloprovincialis is conjectured to be due, in part, to physiological adaptations that enable it to outperform M. trossulus at high temperatures. We have examined the structure and function of the enzyme cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cNMH) from these species, as well as from the more distantly related ribbed mussel, Mytilus californianus, to characterize the effects of temperature on kinetic properties thought to exhibit thermal adaptation. The M. trossulus cMDH ortholog differs from the other cMDHs in a direction consistent with cold adaptation, as evidenced by a higher and more temperature-sensitive Michaelis-Menten constant for the cofactor NADH (K-m(NADH)). This difference results from minor changes in sequence: the M. trossulus ortholog differs from the M. galloprovincialis ortholog by only two substitutions in the 334 amino acid monomer, and the M. californianus and M. trossulus orthologs differ by five substitutions. In each case, only one of these substitutions is non-conservative. To test the effects of individual substitutions on kinetic properties, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create recombinant cMDHs. Recombinant wild-type M. trossulus cMDH (rWT) has high K-m(NADH) compared with mutants incorporating the non-conservative substitutions found in M. californianus and M. galloprovincialis - V114H and V114N, respectively - demonstrating that these mutations are responsible for the differences found in substrate affinity. Turnover number (k(cat)) is also higher in rWT compared with the two mutants, consistent with cold adaptation in the M. trossulus ortholog. Conversely, rWT and V114H appear more thermostable than V114N. Based on a comparison of K-m(NADH) and k(cat) values among the orthologs, we propose that immersion temperatures are of greater selective importance in adapting kinetic properties than the more extreme temperatures that occur during emersion. The relative warm adaptation of M. galloprovincialis cMDH may be one of a suite of physiological characters that enhance the competitive ability of this invasive species in warm habitats.",Web of Science,Mytilus galloprovincialis,,,,,,Lab,marine,Benthic,Invasion Hyp.,Preadaptation to Climate,,filter

Seeds were retained in the gut for an average of 87 min. Mockingbirds ate fruit in more of the trials than did the finches. Finches are confirmed as seed predators as they generally crushed seeds before ingesting them. Only one intact viable blackberry seed was defecated by a Small Ground Finch.

However, little is known about the role of forest edge type in invasive species patterns. In the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, disturbance-caused forest edges are a common feature in the landscape with anthropogenic (e.g. roadside, clearcut) and natural (e.g. burned, windthrown) edge types. In this paper we examine patterns of alien species invasion and native community structure across three forest edge types in Pinus contorta forests including contrasts between undeveloped landscapes in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and developed (roaded and logged) portions of the adjacent Gallatin National Forest (GNF). Six sets of transects were located in each of five study sites, including clearcut, burn and highway edge types. When burn and highways edges were compared between GNF and YNP, landscape matrix did not have a significant effect on either alien species richness or cover. In both landscapes, highway edges had higher alien species richness and cover than burn edges. For burn and highway edges, alien species richness and cover were significantly related to edge type, distance from edge and the interaction between both variables. In Gallatin NF, alien species were concentrated along highway edges, while burn and clearcut edges are significantly less invaded. Overall, alien species richness was negatively correlated with native species richness in plots with at least one alien species (R-2 = 0.30, p < 0.001). We were able to explain from 23 to 68% of the variation in alien species richness from simple measures of vegetation structure within each of the edge types. Our study suggests that at least for high elevation conifer ecosystems such as West Yellowstone, alien plant invasion into interior forest is significantly enhanced by disturbance edges only along roadsides. Further studies are needed to determine causal mechanisms that explain the high degree of invisibility of roadside edges. Our results highlight the need for careful planning and management of roads, as they may become a primary conduit of alien plant invasions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

(Poaccae) was investigated with pollination experiments. Plants were sampled from two populations at Lake Pukaki, Canterbury, New Zealand, where the species is recognised as an alien invader. Bagging of flowers with king-sized cigarette paper and hand-pollination were used to test for three modes of reproduction in the greenhouse: (1) agamospermy (apomixis), (2) autogamy and self-compatibility, and (3) allogamy (outcrossing). Two control groups without experimental treatments were further tested for seed set under (1) greenhouse and (2) field conditions. The success or failure of all experimental treatments was assessed with seed set and germination trials. All agamospermy treatments showed high seed set and germination proportions arguing for an apomictic mode of reproduction in Nardus stricta. Cross-pollination treatments were also successful making it difficult to estimate the degree of outcrossing, selfing, and agamospermous seed production in Nardus stricta. Fecundity in field populations was considerably reduced, possibly due to environmental factors acting upon seed development during maturation. The reproductive strategy of Nardus stricta might be particularly beneficial during invasion because single tussocks can form reproducing colonies and high reproductive output is ensured even in the absence of pollination.

Location: An invaded and fragmented oak savanna ecosystem structured along a landscape-level stress gradient associated with soil depth, elevation, and canopy openness. Methods: Vegetation and environmental data were collected from 184 plots in seven savanna remnants along the gradient. Using multivariate (CCA) and post-hoc regression analyses, we determined the relationship between environment and the richness and abundance of invasives. Results: 46 of 119 species were naturalized exotics. CCA indicated the importance of environmental variation (mostly soil depth) for community structure but not for invasion; invasive species richness was similar in all areas. However, the abundance of invasives and their impacts on native diversity appear to increase significantly in less stressful habitats. Deeper soils had lower evenness and significantly fewer native species. This result was associated with dominance by exotic perennial grasses and large increases in vegetation height, suggesting strong above-ground competition. Conclusions: Low-stress environments were not more invasible per se but appear to be more susceptible to invasion by species with strong competitive impacts. The causes of decreasing exotic impact with decreasing soil depth may reflect shifts in competitive intensity or an increased importance of stress tolerance, both of which may favour natives. Alternatively, this ecosystem may simply lack high-impact invaders capable of dominating shallow soils. Conservation challenges are twofold for this endangered plant community: controlling invasives that currently dominate deeper-soils and accounting for a diverse pool of invaders that proliferate when the current dominants are removed.",Web of Science,Many,Canada,British Columbia,Vancouver Island,48.538432,-123.673096,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

We conducted laboratory and field experiments to examine differential resistance to copper (Cu) between two source populations of the introduced bryozoan Bugula neritina, originating from a polluted (Port Kembla Harbour, NSW, Australia) and an unpolluted (Botany Bay, NSW, Australia) environment. A laboratory toxicity test was conducted to test the relative resistance of B. neritina recruits from the two sources, by measuring the attachment success, survival and growth of individuals exposed to a range of Cu concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 100 mu g l(-1) Cu). Upon completion, reciprocal transplantation of the colonies to the original polluted and unpolluted locations was carried out to assess ongoing survival and growth of colonies in the field. B. neritina colonies originating from the polluted Port Kembla Harbour had increased resistance to Cu relative to populations from an unpolluted part of Botany Bay. There appeared to be a cost associated with increased metal tolerance. In the laboratory, Botany Bay recruits displayed significantly higher growth in control treatments and significantly poorer growth at 100 mu g l(-1) Cu with respect to Port Kembla Harbour individuals, which showed unusually uniform and low growth irrespective of Cu concentration. No difference in attachment success or post-metamorphic survival was observed between populations.

We examined the flower-visiting communities and maternal reproductive success of R. ponticum in native populations in southern Spain and in exotic ones in Ireland. R. ponticum in flowers are visited by various generalist (polylectic) pollinator species in both native and exotic habitats. Although different species visited flowers in Ireland and Spain, the flower visitation rate was not significantly different. Insects foraging on R. ponticum in Spain carried less R. ponticum pollen than their Irish counterparts, and carried fewer pollen types. Fruit production per inflorescence varied greatly within all populations but was significantly correlated with visitation at the population level.

Seeds were dispersed by figbirds, Sphecotheres viridis Vieillot, a locally abundant frugivore, and comprised between 10 and 50% of all non-Ficus spp. fruit consumed during October and November. The rate of removal of O. serrulata drupes was greater in bushland than suburban habitats, indicating that control in bushland habitats should be a priority, but also that suburban habitats are likely to act as significant seed sources for reinvasion of bushland. Germination occurred under all seed-processing treatments ( with and without pulp, and figbird gut passage), suggesting that although frugivores are important for dispersal, they are not essential for germination.

However, little attention has been paid to the importance of the different disturbance regimes in the extent of invasion. In this paper we asked to what extent invasion depends on spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance. By using the spatially explicit model FATELAND, we simulated how Cortaderia selloana, a large-wind dispersed perennial grass invading Mediterranean grasslands, responds to different medium-term (up to 55 years) disturbance regimes. The different scenarios combine disturbance frequency, extent of disturbance and temporal and spatial disturbance variability, and they roughly mimic real situations of habitat management and disturbances in cultural landscapes. The model predicted that the proportion of invaded area would increase with disturbance frequency. The extent of the disturbance overcame the importance of frequency. Aggregated disturbances randomly distributed in space had a more positive effect on invasion than scattered disturbances at repeatedly fixed locations. Whether the disturbances regularly occurred in time or were irregularly distributed did not influence the percentage of invaded landscape. Our simulation analysis unambiguously supports the hypothesis that disturbances are essential for the persistence and expansion of Cortaderia sellona. The high amount of seed rain from a few individuals (e.g., gardens) make this species very sensitive to landscape changes produced by different disturbance patterns (e.g., land abandonment, habitat management or rubbish dumping).

Using several data sets, I examine the role of these factors in non-native species richness of several animal groups: birds, mammals and herptiles (amphibians, reptiles). I also examine if non-native species richness is correlated among these groups. I find, in agreement with Sax [2001, Journal of Biogeography 28: 139-150], that latitude is inversely correlated with non-native species richness of many groups. Once latitude is accounted for, area, human population size and native plant species richness are shown to be important extrinsic factors influencing non-native animal species. Of these extrinsic factors, human population size and native plant species richness are the best predictors of non-native animal species richness. Area, human population size and native plant species richness are highly intercorrelated, along with non-native species richness of all taxa. Indeed a factor analysis shows that a single multivariate axis explains over half of the variation for all variables among the groups. One reason for this covariation is that humans tend to most densely occupy the most productive and diverse habitats where native plant species richness is very high. It is thus difficult to disentangle the effects of human population size and native species richness on non-native species richness. However, it seems likely that these two factors may combine to increase non-native species richness in a synergistic way: high native species richness reflects greater habitat variety available for non-native species, and dense human populations (that preferentially occupy areas rich in native species) increase non-native species importation and disturbance of local habitats.",Web of Science,Many,,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,,,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness;Disturbance;Other,,

In California, USA, undisturbed Mediterranean-type shrublands have resisted invasion by the perennial tussock grass Cortaderia jubata. In some cases, however, this resistance has been spectacularly breached even in the absence of large-scale disturbance. I tested the hypothesis that these invasions are facilitated by local reductions in the strength of biotic resistance. I evaluated invasive success using C. jubata seed and seedling additions at different microhabitats: the edge of a chaparral stand, under shrub canopy at different distances from the stand edge, and in canopy gaps within the stand. When left exposed to mammalian herbivores, seedling survivorship decreased sharply from nearly 40% on the stand edge to zero just 10 m into the stand. When transplants were protected from herbivory, however, distance from the edge had no significant influence on transplant survivorship. Seedling emergence was also greater on the edge and in canopy gaps than under the canopy, but these differences were not caused by differences in herbivory. The flux of invasive propagules reaching the soil surface was immense and greater along the edge and within gaps than under the stand canopy. Mirroring these patterns, naturally occurring seedling abundance declined dramatically with distance from the stand edge, and seedlings were far more common within stand gaps than would be expected given gap frequency within the stand. Despite strong biotic resistance to invasion within the stand, the cover of C. jubata has increased 20% over the last 9 years.

This may occur because exotic and native species respond similarly to processes that influence diversity over large geographical areas. To test this hypothesis, we compared exotic and native species-area relationships within six North American ecoregions. We predicted and found that within ecoregions the ratio of exotic to native species richness remains constant with increasing area. Furthermore, we predicted that areas with more native species than predicted by the species-area relationship would have proportionally more exotics as well. We did find that these exotic and native deviations were highly correlated, but areas that were good (or bad) for native plants were even better (or worse) for exotics.

The plots contain on average 9.0% archaeophytes and 2.3% neophytes; for neophytes, this proportion is much smaller than 26.8% reported for the total flora of the country. Most neophytes are found in a few habitats: only 5.6% of them were recorded in more than ten habitats. By contrast, archaeophytes, and especially native species, tend to occur in a broader range of habitats. Highest numbers of aliens were found on arable land, in annual synantropic vegetation, trampled habitats and anthropogenic tall-forb stands. These habitats contain on average 22-56% archaeophytes and 4.4-9.6% neophytes. Neophytes are also common in artificial broadleaved forestry plantations; they also tend to make up a high percentage of the cover in wet tall-forb stands, but are represented by fewer species there. Entirely or nearly free of aliens are plots located in raised bogs, alpine grasslands, alpine and subalpine scrub and natural coniferous woodlands. Correlations between the number of archaeophytes or neophytes and the number of native species, calculated with habitat mean values, were non-significant, but there was a positive correlation between the numbers of archaeophytes and neophytes. The ratio of archaeophytes to neophytes was high in semi-natural dry and mesic grasslands and low in disturbed habitats with woody vegetation, such as artificial broadleaved forestry plantations, forest clearings and riverine willow stands. When individual plots were compared separately within habitats, the relationships between the number of archaeophytes, neophytes and native species were mostly positive.

Periodic hypoxia represents a pulse disturbance, with the potential to restructure estuarine biotic communities. We chose the shallow, epifaunal community in the lower Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, USA, to test the hypothesis that low dissolved oxygen (DO) (< 4 mg l(-1)) affects community dynamics by reducing the cover of spatial dominants, creating space both for less dominant native species and for invasive species, Settling panels were deployed at shallow depths in spring 2000 and 2001. at Gloucester Point, Virginia, and were manipulated every 2 wk from late June to mid-August. Manipulation involved exposing epifaunal communities to varying levels of DO for up to 24 h followed by redeployment in the York River. Exposure to low DO affected both species composition (presence or absence) and the abundance of the organisms present. Community dominance shifted away from barnacles as level of hypoxia increased. Barnacles were important spatial dominants which reduced species diversity when locally abundant. The cover of Hydroides dianthus, a native serpulid polychaete, doubled when exposed to periodic hypoxia. Increased H. dianthus cover may indicate whether a local region has experienced periodic, local DO depletion and thus provide an indicator of poor water-quality conditions.

Results: Pittosporum was unrecorded in the intensive sites before a severe hurricane in 1988: by 2004 all four sites were invaded. Pittosporum had invaded 25% of the extensive plots in 1990 and 69% in 2004, where its basal area increased from 0.5 +/- 0.4 (SEM) m(2).ha(-1) in 1990 to 2.8 +/- 1.3 m(2).ha(-1) in 2004. It had zero stem mortality and diameter growth rate exceeded that of native species fourfold. Pittosporum's basal area in the extensive plots in 2004 was positively related to the stand basal area damaged in the 1988 hurricane and negatively related to soil N concentrations. Pittosporum invasion was unrelated to stand-level tree species diversity in the extensive plots but as its basal area increased over time the basal area of native species and stand-level diversity declined.

Due to accelerating invasion rates and widespread economic costs and environmental damages caused by invasive species, colonization theory has lately become a matter of considerable interest. Here we review the concept of propagule pressure to inquire if colonization theory might provide quantitative tools for risk assessment of biological invasions. By formalizing the concept of propagule pressure in terms of stochastic differential equation models of population growth, we seek a synthesis of invasion biology and theoretical population biology. We focus on two components of propagule pressure that affect the chance of invasion: (1) the number of individuals initially introduced, and (2) the rate of subsequent immigration. We also examine how Allee effects, which are expected to be common in newly introduced populations, may inhibit establishment of introduced propagules. We find that the establishment curve (i.e., the chance of invasion as a function of initial population size), can take a variety of shapes depending on immigration rate, carrying capacity, and the severity of Allee effects. Additionally, Allee effects can cause the stationary distribution of population sizes to be bimodal, which we suggest is a possible explanation for time lags commonly observed between the detection of an introduced population and widespread invasion of the landscape.",Web of Science,,,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,

To develop an understanding of factors that may be contributing to B's invasive capacity, inter-biotype mating interactions and host plant suitability for the exotic B (B. tabaci Mediterranean/Asia Minor/Africa) and the indigenous Australian (AN) biotype (B. tabaci Australia) were examined. The results suggest that when confined to a mutually acceptable host, B cannot establish when the ratio of AN : B exceeds 20 : 1. However, when simultaneously provided with a host that only it prefers, B is able to establish even at 50 : 1 (AN : B). Further, when both biotypes occur together the number of progeny per female increases (relative to the number produced when only one biotype is present). The response is observed for both biotypes, but is considerably greater in the case of B. In addition, B performs better in the presence of the AN biotype B. tabaci Australia while AN perform worse in coexistence with B, but only if the demographics allow B to mate without significant interference.

The population dynamics of mile-a-minute weed, Polygonum perfoliatum L., was explored in both the native (Japan) and novel (northeastern USA) portions of its range and evaluated using periodic matrix models. Projected per capita population growth rate (lambda) varied within and between native and novel range populations. Surprisingly, five of the six populations in the novel range were projected to fail to replace themselves (lambda<1) while only two of the four native range populations were projected to decline, although these projections had wider confidence intervals than in the novel habitat. While changes in germination, survivorship, fecundity and seed banking would have equivalent effects on population growth in the invasive habitat, small increases in plant survivorship would greatly increase lambda in native populations. The differences between native and novel population growth rates were driven by lower adult survival in the native range caused by annual flooding and higher fecundity. Simulation analyses indicated that a 50% reduction in plant survival would be required to control growing populations in the novel range. Further comparative studies of other invading species in both their native and novel ranges are needed to examine whether the high per capita population growth and strong regulatory effects of adult survival in the native habitat are generally predictive of invasive behavior in novel habitats.",Web of Science,Polygonum perfoliatum,USA,Pennsylvania,Ridley Creek State Park,39.943871,-75.444174,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,,primary

Soil moisture and canopy cover were greater in the invaded patch than the native forest. There was no difference in soil fertility or understory light levels between locations. These demographic (i.e. seedling survival), physiological, and environmental differences appeared to be due to the effects of A. platanoides and P. menziesii trees. Thus, Acer trees appear to produce a more mesic environment by modifying the structure and phenology of the forest canopy and by altering the timing of transpirational water loss relative to P. menziesii.

Few non-native species, however, have invaded them. A feature of species-rich grasslands is the presence of a bryophyte mat (composed of mosses and liverworts) that carpets the intertussock spaces. I assessed the role of these mats in plant invasions by sowing three non-native species (Briza maxima, Hypochoeris radicata, Plantago lanceolata) in replicated disturbed (mats removed) and undisturbed (mats intact) microsites at three grassland remnants (two recently burnt, one unburnt for 3 years) and followed seedling emergence, survival and growth for 5 months. Three native species were also sown for comparison. The rate of germination and total percent germination of non-native species were significantly enhanced at both burnt sites when the mat was disturbed. The large-seeded Briza maxima failed to germinate at both burnt sites in the absence of soil disturbance. The native species generally did not show a strong germination or growth response to soil disturbance in burnt areas. At the unburnt site, where monthly percent soil moisture was highest, final percent germination of the non-native and native species was greatest of any site in both microsites, and germination was not significantly affected by soil disturbance. Differences in the seed morphology of native and non-native species may play an important role in their ability to establish on bryophyte mats in moisture-limiting environments. Any activity that disrupts the mats in the frequently burnt, species-rich grassland remnants is likely to significantly enhance the germination and subsequent growth by non-natives.

Using multivariate techniques, we examined the structure of a plant-pollinator web comprising both alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering time, site and habitat disturbance. 2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed between alien and native plants. 3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on average, equally associated with native and alien plant species. 4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness (3.6% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20% of all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could have a significant impact in terms of pollination. 5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web.

Nonetheless, these microclimatic conditions could facilitate the establishment of non-native species as well. A conspicuous component of the alien alpine flora of the central Chilean Andes is the perennial herb Taraxacum officinale agg. (dandelion). In contrast to other alien species that are restricted to human-disturbed sites, T officinale is frequently observed growing within native plant communities dominated by cushion plants. In this study we evaluated if T officinale is positively associated with the cushion plant Azorella monantha. Via seedling survival experiments and gas-exchange measurements we also assessed the patterns of facilitation between cushions and dandelions, and explore the potential mechanisms of invasion by dandelions. T officinale grows spatially positively associated with cushions of A. monantha. Survival of seedlings, as well as their net-photo synthetic rates and stomatal conductance., were higher within cushions than in open areas away from them, suggesting that the microclimatic modifications generated by this native cushion facilitates the establishment and performance of a non-native invasive species.

Our aim was to investigate variation in plant species richness, particularly of the alien flora, along a gradient from coastal shrubland to summit vegetation (1950 m a.s.l. in Gran Canaria, 2300 m in Tenerife) in relation to variation in habitat factors (altitude, habitat structure, roadside disturbance, distance to urban nuclei). We compared different species groups that were classified in terms of their biogeographical status, origin and life form. Altitude was the most important factor determining species richness and composition along both roadside transects. Alien plants showed a unimodal distribution pattern along the altitudinal gradient, with less species and lower abundance at low and high altitudes, and highest abundance at intermediate altitude. Alien plant species were also relatively more frequent near urban centres. The number of native and alien species was significantly positively correlated along the altitudinal gradient. Both alien and native, non-endemic species showed differences in their distribution along the altitudinal gradient according to their biogeographical affinities and climatic tolerances. Despite considerable differences in species pools these patterns were consistent among the two islands. Environmental (abiotic) stress is proposed as a primary, altitude-related factor acting as a filter against most alien plants at coastal and high-mountain altitudes. A higher frequency or intensity of disturbance at intermediate altitudes may be a further causal factor promoting alien plants in this zone. Future management efforts to control alien plants along roads should, therefore, concentrate on intermediate altitudinal zones of the higher Canary Islands. (c) 2005 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

The altitudinal distribution of species was related to the current abundance of the species in Switzerland and time since introduction. A total of 155 alien taxa were recorded. Numbers of species per site declined exponentially with altitude, and only a few species were found in the alpine zone (> 2000 m). In contrast, species richness among comparable native taxa appeared to be nearly independent of altitude over the range investigated. Maximum altitude reached by alien species was related positively to both total area occupied in Switzerland and to time since introduction. A comparison of the results with earlier records suggests that many species, particularly those previously restricted to low or intermediate altitudes, have advanced their altitudinal limits over the past few decades. Various hypotheses are presented to explain the declining abundance of alien species with altitude: low-altitude filter effects, low propagule pressure, and genetic swamping of peripheral populations at higher altitudes. However, at present we do not have sufficient evidence to determine the relative importance of these effects. We conclude that invasion into mountain areas such as the Swiss Alps tends to proceed rather slowly, though the process may be accelerated by climatic warming. For this reason, further research to investigate the processes determining how plants invade mountain areas is urgently needed. And more generally, investigations into the distribution of alien species along strong altitudinal gradients may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving the spread of alien organisms.

Most of these are forbs and most are uncommon. Cover of invasive species is generally minimal unless there has been gross disturbance to natural vegetation and soils. Although there is a significantly positive correlation between invasive and native species diversity, suggesting that conditions that allow numerous native species to co-exist also permit more plant invasions, altitude is the most important determinant of invasive species diversity. Only 22 of the 128 species have been recorded above 1800 in. Some plant communities (e.g. those with high pH or relatively nutrient-rich soils), however, seem to be vulnerable to invasions regardless of altitude. Most invasive species appear to have been introduced unintentionally (e.g. as seed attached to vehicles, animals and humans) but a few were introduced to assist with revegetation of disturbed soils and for amenity plantings in ski resorts, and have subsequently established in native vegetation. Treeless communities in the Australian Alps are likely to face increasing pressure from invasive species as a result of global warming and continued introduction of non-native plants to ski resort gardens. Whilst it may be difficult to prevent invasive species of low elevations migrating to higher elevations as temperatures rise, the risk of invasion from garden plants could be minimised through regulation. Non-native plants in ski resort gardens pose a far greater risk than most invasive species currently present in the Alps because they have been chosen for their capacity to survive at high altitudes.

We measured watershed development as the percentage of area within each watershed occupied by urban land uses. Streams in more developed watersheds often bad exotic crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and fish, and had fewer native species such as California newts (Taricha torosa) and California treefrogs (Hyla cadaverina). These effects seemed particularly evident above 8% development a result coincident with other urban stream studies that show negative impacts beginning at 10-15% urbanization. For Pacific treefrogs (H. regilla), the most widespread native amphibian, abundance was lower in the presence of exotic crayfish, although direct urbanization effects were not found. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities were also less diverse in. urban streams, especially for sensitive species. Faunal community changes in urban streams may be related to changes in physical stream habitat, such as fewer pool and more run habitats and increased water depth and flow, leading to more permanent streams. Variation in stream permanence was particularly evident in 2002 a dry year when many natural streams were dry but urban streams were relatively unchanged.

Reduced top-down control (*enemy release*) following this escape is often invoked to explain demographic expansion of invasive species and also may alter the selective regime for invasive species: reduced damage can allow resources previously allocated to defence to be reallocated to other functions like growth and reproduction. This reallocation may provide invaders with an *evolution of increased competitive ability* over natives that defend themselves against specialist enemies. We tested for enemy release and the evolution of increased competitive ability in the North American native ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifblia: Asteraceae), which currently is invading France. We found evidence of enemy release in natural field populations from the invaded and native ranges. Further we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment, comparing several life history traits of plants from two North American (Ontario and South Carolina) and one French population in four common gardens on both continents. French and Canadian plants had similar flowering phenologies, flowering earlier than plants from further south in the native range. This may suggest that invasive French plants originated from similar latitudes to the Canadian population sampled. As with natural populations, experimental plants suffered far less herbivore damage in France than in Ontario.

Both cover and richness of aliens varied between years and plant association. Alien cover was lowest in the first postfire year in all plant associations and remained low during succession in chaparral but increased in sage scrub. Alien cover and richness were significantly correlated with year (time since disturbance) and with precipitation in both coastal and interior sage scrub associations. Hypothesized. factors determining alien dominance were tested with structural equation modeling. Models that included nitrogen deposition and distance from the coast were not significant, but with those variables removed we obtained a significant model that gave an R-2 = 0.60 for the response variable of fifth year alien dominance. Factors directly affecting alien dominance were (1) woody canopy closure and (2) alien seed banks. Significant indirect effects were (3) fire intensity, (4) fire history, (5) prefire stand structure, (6) aridity, and (7) community type. According to this model the most critical factor influencing aliens is the rapid return of the shrub and subshrub canopy. Thus, in these communities a single functional type (woody plants) appears to the most critical element controlling alien invasion and persistence. Fire history is an important indirect factor because it affects both prefire stand structure and postfire alien seed banks. Despite being fire-prone ecosystems, these shrublands are not adapted to fire per se, but rather to a particular fire regime. Alterations in the fire regime produce a very different selective environment, and high fire frequency changes the selective regime to favor aliens.

During the last decades, this species has invaded heathland communities in Western Europe, replacing typical heathland species such as Calluna vulgaris and Erica tetralix. M. caerulea is considered a major threat to heathland conservation. In 1996, a large and unintended fire destroyed almost one-third of the Kalmthoutse Heide, a large heathland area in northern Belgium. To study the impact of this fire on the population dynamics and invasive spread of M. caerulea, permanent monitoring plots were established both in burned and unburned heathland. The fate of each M. caerulea individual in these plots was monitored over four years (1997-2000). Patterns of seed dispersal were inferred from a seed germination experiment using soil cores sampled one month after seed rain at different distances from seed-producing plants. Based on these measures, we calculated projected rates of spread for M. caerulea in burned and unburned heathland. Elasticity and sensitivity analyses were used to determine vital rates that contributed most to population growth rate, and invasion speed. Invasion speed was, on average, three times larger in burned compared to unburned plots. Dispersal distances on the other hand, were not significantly different between burned and unburned plots indicating If at differences in invasive spread, were mainly due to differences in demography. Elasticities for fecundity and growth of seedlings and juveniles were higher for burned than for unburned plots, whereas elasticities for survival were higher in unburned plots: Finally, a life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis revealed that the effect of fire was mainly contributed by increases in sexual reproduction (seed production and germination) and growth of seedlings and juveniles. Our results clearly showed, increased invasive spread of M. caerulea after fire, and call for active management guidelines to prevent further encroachment of the species and to reduce the probability of large, accidental fires in the future.

Lawson) forests of the western United States. Also, the recent increase in large, stand-replacing wildfires may promote introduction and spread of species, such as diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa Lam.), which may lead to reduced forage and land values and major ecosystem changes. We hypothesized that diffuse knapweed germination and seedling growth would respond positively to burned conditions in northern Arizona ponderosa pine forests. Our first field study was based on a May 2002 wildfire near Flagstaff, Arizona (Site I). For the field study at Site I, we buried diffuse knapweed seeds in sealed mesh packets in four forest floor conditions: severely burned, moderately burned, unburned bare soil and unburned. We removed packets monthly and measured percent germination. Germination under severely burned conditions at Site I (overall average 76%) was higher than in unburned conditions (59%) (P = 0.017). Our second field study was based on a fuel reduction treatment with slash piles burned in February 2003 (Site H). Germination in seed packets was higher (P = 0.003) in pile burn scars (67%) than in adjacent unburned locations (38%) at Site II. In fall 2002, we planted knapweed seeds in pots containing intact 'oil cores from Site I from unburned and severely burned conditions. We allowed competition to grow in half the pots, and removed competition in the other half. Diffuse knapweed biomass/pot was greater (P = 0.035) in soil from the severely burned (2.6 g) compared to the unburned condition (0.6 g) from Site I. Knapweed biornass/pot also appeared greater when grown in soil from pile burn scars (3.3 g) compared with unburned locations (2.5 g) from Site II, although the difference was not significant (P = 0.317). We conclude that severe wildfire or pile burning can promote germination and seedling growth of diffuse knapwecd in northern Arizona pine forests. Moreover, diffuse knapweed may also threaten unburned forests, as average germination was 48% in unburned locations. Failure to consider exotic invasive species in fuel reduction and wildfire rehabilitation may result in trading one undesirable condition for another. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Artificial structures have become ubiquitous features of coastal landscapes. Although they provide novel habitats for the colonization of marine organisms, their role in facilitating biological invasions has been largely unexplored. 2. We investigated the distribution and dynamics of the introduced green alga, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, at a variety of spatial scales on breakwaters in the north Adriatic Sea, and analysed experimentally the mechanisms underlying its establishment. We assessed the provision of sheltered habitats by breakwaters, the role of disturbance (e.g. from recreational harvesting and storms) acting at different times of the year, and the interactions between Codium and the dominant native space-occupier, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. 3. Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides has established viable populations on artificial structures along the shores investigated. The density, cover and size (length, branching and weight) of annual erect thalli of Codium was enhanced in sheltered conditions, resulting in the monopolization of landward low-shore habitats of breakwaters. 4. On the landward sides of breakwaters, disturbance enhanced recruitment of Codium. The time when bare space was provided within mussels beds was crucial. Removal of mussels in April or January did not affect the recruitment of Codium, whereas harvest in August, shortly before Codium gamete release, doubled its success. On the seaward sides of breakwaters, the effects of disturbance were more complex because mussels both inhibited recruitment of Codium and provided shelter from wave action to adult thalli. 5. Synthesis and applications. Artificial structures can provide suitable habitats for non-indigenous marine species and function as corridors for their expansion. Physical (wave exposure) and biotic (resident assemblages) features of artificial habitats can be important determinants of their susceptibility to biological invasions. Alternative options in the design of artificial structures and effective management of native assemblages could minimize their role in biological invasions. In particular, increased water motion and retention of space by mussels in spring-summer would be effective in reducing the ability of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides to persist on the breakwaters investigated in this study.",Web of Science,Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides,Italy,Trieste,Adriatic Sea,45.67673,13.756027,Field - Experimental,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

One of the most prominent, the Enemy Release Hypothesis, posits that invading species benefit compared to their native counterparts if they lose their herbivores and pathogens during the invasion process. We previously reported on a common garden experiment (from 2002) in which we compared levels of herbivory between 30 taxonomically paired native and introduced old-field plants. In this phylogenetically controlled comparison, herbivore damage tended to be higher on introduced than on native plants. This striking pattern, the opposite of current theory, prompted us to further investigate herbivory and several other interspecific interactions in a series of linked experiments with the same set of species. Here we show that, in these new experiments, introduced plants, on average, received less insect herbivory and were subject to half the negative soil microbial feedback compared to natives; attack by fungal and viral pathogens also tended to be reduced on introduced plants compared to natives. Although plant traits (foliar C:N, toughness, and water content) suggested that introduced species should be less resistant to generalist consumers, they were not consistently more heavily attacked. Finally, we used meta-analysis to combine data from this study with results from our previous work to show that escape generally was inconsistent among guilds of enemies: there were few instances in which escape from multiple guilds occurred for a taxonomic pair, and more cases in which the patterns of escape from different enemies canceled out. Our examination of multiple interspecific interactions demonstrates that escape from one guild of enemies does not necessarily imply escape from other guilds. Because the effects of each guild are likely to vary through space and time, the net effect of all enemies is also likely to be variable. The net effect of these interactions may create *invasion opportunity windows*: times when introduced species make advances in native communities.",Web of Science,Many,United States,New York,,44.05,-79.4833,Garden;Review,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release;Other,,primary

Long-term common garden studies with Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), a problematic invader in the southeastern United States, support EICA predictions of invasive ecotypes displaying rapid growth with poorly defended leaves, whereas native ecotypes are slower growing and have nitrogen rich, highly defended leaves. We conducted two full-factorial experiments designed to assess the effects of leaf herbivory and soil fertility on growth of Sapium seedlings derived from seeds obtained in the species' native Chinese range and introduced range along the Texas Gulf Coast. The first was a field study employing simulated defoliation to examine herbivory tolerance, while the second was a pot study using grasshopper bioassays to measure the compensatory regrowth of native and introduced Sapium ecotypes. In accordance with EICA predictions, introduced Texas ecotypes compensated for mechanical and natural defoliation regardless of resource conditions while growth of native Chinese ecotypes was significantly reduced as a result of both simulated and natural herbivory damage. These results demonstrate that invasive Sapium ecotypes have a greater capacity to compensate for herbivory damage than native Sapium ecotypes.

Nearly all the hard substrata in Elkhorn Slough, as in most estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America, are artificial (jetties, rip-rap, docks).

Few unregulated rivers remain to provide baseline information for assessing these impacts. We characterized patterns in riparian plant communities along chronosequences on the unregulated Yampa River and the regulated Green River in northwestern Colorado, examining patterns in plant species diversity in relation to the ages of floodplain terraces. On both rivers, mean plant species richness in cottonwood (Populus deltoides Marshall subsp. wislizenzii (Watson) Eckenwalder) dominated riparian forests declined by more than 50% from young sites ( < 20 years) to old upland terraces ( > 250 years).

Species richness (including vascular plants and mosses) at some sites was relatively high (c. 40 species), but species richness and abundance were significantly reduced in quadrats with high Nardus stricta density. Seedling densities of Nardus stricta were high but variable (overall mean of 38.6 116 seedlings per m(2)), and establishment mainly occurred on the cushion-forming sedge Oreobolus pectinatus. Most reproductive tussocks (90%) produced up to 1000 florets, but single tussocks were able to produce up to 10 000 and more florets. Our results suggest that Nardus stricta is still expanding its local range and, therefore, is likely to increase in abundance and dominance, resulting in further negative effects on native species diversity.",Web of Science,Nardus stricta ,New Zealand,South Canterbury,Lake Pukaki,-44.169104,170.112076,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Wetland,Impacts;Fundamentals,,,primary

Species that have straight sections on logarithmic, square root, and arithmetic plots were found; the last group (10 of them) are generally casuals. Straight square root plots (52 found) are expected from Fisher-Skellam reaction diffusion models, logarithmic equivalents (36 found) where the dispersal kernel has a thicker tail or where spread involves scattered colonies. The greater frequency of the straight square root plots is unexpected. The straightness of so many plots shows that there is no significant variation in recorder bias. About a third of the species showed lags, and many species showed a later slowing of the rate of spread, called here bends. Lags may indicate an initial casual phase as well as slower growth; bends, a lack of further areas to spread to. Typically, with much variation, areas of occupancy double in about 10 y (logarithmic mode) or spread at about 2 km (.) y(-1) (square root mode). Both speeds indicate that most spread is from human activity. The reasons for the major phenomena (the occurrence of the two types of spread predicted by models, their distinctness, and the distribution in rates) may reflect economic and landscape features as well as biological ones.

The communities of each subsystem were compared with respect to the landscape structure (35 patch types) and to their distribution according to the distance to the bank of each water body, the distance to the main channel of the river, the annual duration of inundation, the total plant cover, the total species richness, and the proportion of exotics. Although significant contrasts exist between the community structures of each water body, we found a strong correlation between the attributes of native and exotic species pools. Native and exotic species covers were negatively correlated, while native species richness was positively correlated to exotic species richness, both at local and large scale. This positive correlation remained significant when comparing plots within each patch type. Few or no differences were detected between the distribution of native and exotic species according to the six variables of interest, the effect of the origin (exotic or native) of the plants being negligible as a discriminant attribute.

We considered all alien plant species for which we had records and a subset of these - those that invade natural and semi-natural vegetation. The main source of data for species richness of indigenous and alien plant species was a national database based on herbarium specimens. For invasive alien species, data were from a national atlassing project. First, we explored the importance of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity as correlates of indigenous, alien, and invasive alien plant species richness. Linear regression models showed that species richness in the three groups of plants was explained by the same variables: a principal component of climatic factors and topographic roughness were the top-ranking variables for all groups. Next, we examined the role of indigenous species richness together with a range of environmental and human-activity variables in explaining species richness of alien and invasive alien plants. Results reveal an interplay of natural features and variables that quantify the dimension of human activities. If indigenous species richness is ignored, human-activity variables are more strongly correlated with alien species richness than with invasive alien species richness. Numbers of alien and invasive species in QDSs are significantly correlated with indigenous plant species richness in the 1,597 QDSs selected for analysis, a pattern consistent with findings from other parts of the world. Analysis of residuals between observed and predicted values showed that patterns differed between biomes.

We reconstructed the spread of reed canarygrass in Quebec using herbarium specimens and a method that accounts for some of the biases associated with this type of historical record. We hypothesized that the beginning of the spread of the species coincided with the introduction in Canada of reed canarygrass cultivars for forage. Reed canarygrass specimens collected during the 19(th) century in places as remote as Lake Mistassini and Anticosti Island provide strong evidence that this species is native to northeastern North America. The spatial distribution of specimens collected before 1925 suggests that reed canarygrass probably occupied most of its present-day area at that time. There is no strong evidence that reed canarygrass expanded its distribution limits in Quebec during the 20(th) century. However, the species colonized several new sites within its distribution limits in recent decades, especially from 1963 to 1978.

What are the spatio-temporal processes involved in pine invasions in contrasting Mediterranean and semi-arid climatic regions? Location: Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of Israel. Methods: The density of invading Pinus was measured in relation to the distance from the plantation edge. Plants were categorized by age, height, basal stem girth and developmental stage, their spatial distribution was also recorded. Results: Analysis of plant age distribution indicates that the invasion process started when the plantations were 20-25 years old. Most invading plants were found within 20 m from the plantation edge, but a few individuals reached distances up to 100 m and became new invasion foci. Plant density declined sharply with distance from adult trees, data showing a better fit to a power model than to a negative exponential model. Invading Pinus began to produce cones earlier in the semi-arid than in the Mediterranean region (9 vs 12 years to 50% reproductive plants). In both regions, higher densities of invading plants were found on the west side of the plantation, the opposite direction to the hot winds that prevail during seed release. Conclusion: The frontal advance of P. halepensis from plantations is relatively slow, but the populations also expand by a saltation process, creating spreading 'islands' of pine trees in the natural vegetation. Spatial pattern of recruits with distance from the source population was remarkably similar to the pattern of seed dispersal in the same region (Nathan et al. 1999).

Subpopulation size inside gaps was positively related to gap size, and components of individual plant size increased with increasing gap size and canopy openness. Moreover, the reproductive effort of L. camara increased with gap size and canopy openness, whereas the fruit production of individual plants was unrelated to gap size and canopy openness. Finally, there was no relationship between gap size and pollinator visitation to inflorescence, but a marginally significant relationship occurred between canopy openness and pollinator visitation.

During winter 2001 and 2002, we planted 100 Centaurea seeds in 64 pairs of 30 x 30 cm plots (uncleared and cleared of aboveground plant material) at sites stratified by distance from roads (10 m and > 1000 m), soil type (nonserpentine and serpentine), and aspect (cool, warm, and neutral slopes). In nonserpentine grasslands, Centaurea survival was greater in uncleared (but not cleared) near (10 m) plots than in distant (> 1000 m) plots. These findings suggest that the effect of distance from roads on survival corresponds with higher aboveground biotic resistance in distant sites than in near sites. Centaurea biomass was greater in near than in distant plots (both uncleared and cleared) on nonserpentine soil, suggesting that either abiotic resistance or below ground biotic resistance could limit its growth in distant sites. These distance effects were no longer significant in models that included two biotic covariates: native grass cover (which was higher in distant sites and negatively correlated with Centaurea performance) and bare ground (which was lower in distant sites and positively correlated with Centaurea performance). On serpentine soil, there was no effect of road proximity on the performance of planted Centaurea. Our results suggest that Centaurea seeds can germinate in nonserpentine and serpentine grasslands regardless of distance from roads.

Occasionally invasion occurs where the exotic species possesses functional traits relatively similar to those of the dominant native. We examined the ecological consequences of such an invasion within a mesic, temperate grassland at the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site. We assessed potential changes in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and plant diversity following the invasion of a C-4 bunch grass species, Andropogon bladhii, into a tallgrass prairie dominated by the native C-4 grass species, A. gerardii. In these prairies burning is an important management tool used to maintain native-species dominance. We determined how frequent spring fires affected the impacts of A. bladhii in this system. Over a two-year study our results show that burning regulated the effects that the invasive species has on the native prairie. Compared to the native species, A. bladhii exhibited significantly greater plant biomass, significantly lower pools of soil N, significantly lower rates of decay and C cycling, and higher foliar and root tissue C:N ratio in response to burning. Notable spatial heterogeneity in C and N cycling was evident in areas dominated by the invasive bunch grass. In addition to altered ecosystem processes, areas dominated by the invasive, A. bladhii, had significantly lower plant species diversity. In a grassland ecosystem where burning is an important management tool for controlling exotic-species establishment, maintaining native-species dominance, and increasing productivity, A. bladhii may be able to successfully out-compete the native C-4 grass species by using traits typically used to explain the dominance of the native species. With frequent fire, the invasive species has the potential to decrease long-term fertility by lowering N inputs in litter and increasing erosion in non-vegetated soil between bunches, while also having a negative effect on plant diversity.

To provide initial data to assess this hypothesis, we measured metabolic, locomotor, and reproductive responses to inflammatory challenges in North American populations of the highly invasive house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and its less-invasive relative, the tree sparrow (Passer montanus). In the house sparrow, there was no effect of phytohemagglutimn (PHA) challenge on metabolic rate, and there were no detectable differences in locomotor activity between lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected birds and saline-injected controls.

In a common garden captive breeding experiment, there was no effect of killed-bacteria injections on reproduction in the house sparrow, while tree sparrows challenged with bacteria decreased egg production by 40% compared to saline-injected controls.

We conducted a manipulative field experiment to test the relationship between common human disturbances and invasibility in hard-substrate marine epifaunal communities. A larval dosing technique was developed to allow marine experimental units to be dosed with a controlled supply of propagules under field conditions. Six month old assemblages were exposed to 3 fully crossed factors of (1) physical disturbance, (2) chemical disturbance, and (3) timing of larval dose relative to the disturbances. Physical disturbance was shown to increase the invasion success of the introduced species, Bugula neritina, up to 30 d following the disturbance. This was mainly through an increase of recruitment onto primary space, however physical impacts with an antifoulant surface also led to increased recruitment on secondary space. After 15 d, B. neritina recruits on primary space were found to be larger than recruits on secondary space, suggesting an elevated threat of invasion through primary recruitment. Natural recruitment of barnacles, ascidians, and sedentary polychaetes was also increased by physical disturbance, although these effects were weaker and varied between taxa and sampling times.

Plants with the highest reproductive effort in the first year of growth died regardless of coastal site of origin, although nearly all of those that died over two years were invasive Pacific plants (27%). The invaders set two times the seed as the natives under forced selfing, suggesting greater self-compatibility or reproductive effort.

However, although plant abundance is strongly controlled by root herbivores and soil pathogens, there is very little knowledge on how invasive plants escape from belowground enemies. We therefore investigated if the general pattern for aboveground pathogens also applies to root-feeding nematodes and used the natural foredune grass Ammophila arenaria as a model. In the late 1800s, the European A. arenaria was introduced into southeast Australia (Tasmania), New Zealand, South Africa, and the west coast of the USA to be used for sand stabilization. In most of these regions, it has become a threat to native vegetation, because its excessive capacity to stabilize windblown sand has changed the geomorphology of coastal dunes. In stable dunes of most introduced regions, A. arenaria is more abundant and persists longer than in stabilized dunes of the natural range. We collected soil and root samples and used additional literature data to quantify the taxon richness of root-feeding nematodes on A. arenaria in its natural range and collected samples from the four major regions where it has been introduced. In most introduced regions A. arenaria did not have fewer root-feeding nematode taxa than the average number in its natural range, and native plant species did not have more nematode taxa than the introduced species. However, in the introduced range native plants had more feeding-specialist nematode taxa than A. arenaria and major feeding specialists (the sedentary endoparasitic cyst and root knot nematodes) were not found on A. arenaria in the southern hemisphere. We conclude that invasiveness of A. arenaria correlates with escape from feeding specialist nematodes, so that the pattern of escape from root-feeding nematodes is more alike escape from aboveground insect herbivores than escape from aboveground pathogens and viruses. In the natural range of A. arenaria, the number of specialist-feeding nematode taxa declines towards the margins. Growth experiments are needed to determine the relationship between nematode taxon diversity, abundance, and invasiveness of A. arenaria.",Web of Science,Ammophila arenaria,USA; New Zealand; Australia,,,46.099968; -40.378773; -41.144949,-123.937118; 175.225525; 146.628571,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

Indeed, profound. effects of some parasites and predators on host populations are well documented. However, some support for the ERH comes from studies that find a reduction in the species richness of enemies in the introduced range, relative to the native range, of particular hosts. For example, data on helminth parasites of the European starling in both its native Eurasia and in North America support a reduction of parasites in the latter. However, North American 'founder' starlings were likely not chosen randomly from across Eurasia. This could result in an overestimation of enemy release since enemies affect their hosts on a population level. We control for the effects of subsampling colonists and find, contrary to previous reports, no evidence that introduced populations of starlings experienced a reduction in the species richness of helminth parasites after colonization of North America.

We investigated whether introduced bison on Santa Catalina Island, California, have the potential to spread non-native plants through the shedding of clumps of seed-laden hair and/or ingesting and later excreting seeds. We collected clumps of hair shaved from bison during a roundup and dislodged by wallowing activity. Greenhouse and field trials were used to test for seed viability and persistence of hair clumps in wallows. In addition to trials with bison hair, we collected samples of bison dung and tested for seed germination in a greenhouse. The majority of seeds extracted from bison hair clumps were of non-native forbs. There was a significant positive relationship between the size of hair clumps and the number of seeds extracted from the clumps, suggesting that managing the introduced bison population at a lower level will help minimize the spread of non-native plants by the species. Seeds of non-native plants were capable of germinating under conditions similar to those on Santa Catalina Island. Clumps of bison hair persisted in wallows, but did not remain intact and lost nearly 40% of their original mass. The number of germinable seeds contained in bison dung was low: 18 seeds germinated from 6 of 18 dung samples.

The remaining 38 species are considered extinct, i.e. alien plants not capable of long-term survival in the country. The resulting survival rate of wool aliens is 22.1%. Three species on the list (5.4%) were clearly capable of naturalization. Compared to the other alien flora of the Czech Republic, wool aliens were disproportionally introduced from Australia, Africa and South and Central America. Species from Europe and Africa tended to survive the best. Grasses were. most strongly represented, contributing 62.5% to wool alien species but only 7.9% to the total Czech neophyte flora. All surviving species were annuals, whereas none of the perennials survived; the survival rate in annuals was 37.5%. Survival of species introduced with wool was significantly comparable to their performance in the UK and in Central Europe, indicating that survival is not determined by mere chance and that the same species tend to be successful elsewhere in Europe.

International or domestic translocation of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides is usually attributed to the fouling of ship hulls or shellfish, particularly oysters. A likely domestic vector is shipboard transport, involving the translocation of whole thalli or fragments entangled in fishing nets, ropes, etc. that are then released in a previously unaffected area. Here we investigated the survival of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides under emersed conditions, simulating shipboard transport. C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides was able to survive periods of emersion of up to 90 days in high relative air humidity. Net photosynthesis remained positive at about 50% of the rates of submersed control thalli. After 2 days of emersion and 4 days of rehydration under submersed conditions thalli recover to their initial net photosynthesis rates. Hence, C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides is likely to survive long shipboard journeys entrapped in fishing nets, anchor wells. or other protected, high-humidity areas of a vessel. Furthermore, C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides may survive emersion on an exposed deck during short trips, especially in cooler conditions such as at night.

Here, we report that exotic grasses can also indirectly increase disease incidence in nearby native grasses. We found that the presence of A. fatua more than doubled incidence of infection by barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) in E. glaucus. Because B/CYDV infection can stunt E. glaucus and other native bunchgrasses, the indirect effects of A. fatua on virus incidence in natives suggests that apparent competition may be an additional mechanism influencing interactions among exotic and native grasses in California. A. fatua's influence on virus incidence is likely mediated by its effects on populations of aphids that vector B/CYDVs. In our study, aphids consistently preferred exotic annuals as hosts and experienced higher fecundity on them, suggesting that the exotics can attract and amplify vector populations.

Also, soil from the lightly invaded site was treated with a water extract of E. adenophorum roots to examine the effect of the plant on soil properties. We grew three plant species, one native and two exotic, in pot experiment using soil from heavily invaded site to examine the effects of the soil on these plants growth. The soil analysis demonstrated that the pH, organic matter, total N, total P and total K in soils from the heavily invaded site were only slightly different from those of the lightly invaded site, but concentrations of NH4+, NO3- and available P and K in the heavily invaded site were greater than those in the lightly invaded site. The catabolic activity of soil bacterial community in the heavily invaded site was different from that in the lightly invaded site. The catabolic activity of bacterial community in soils treated by the water extract of E. adenophorum roots changed and became similar to that in soils from the heavily invaded site. The pot experiment showed that the exotic plants growth in heavily invaded soil were not different from in lightly invaded soil; however, the native plant biomass decreased dramatically when grown in soil from the heavily invaded site as compared to soil from the lightly invaded site; and the same phenomenon was found when any potential allelopathic effects by E. adenophorum were eliminated by added activated carbon to those soils. Difference in soil nutrient availability and allelopathy could not explain this phenomenon of the native plant in the soils from the heavily and lightly invaded sites. Changes observed in the soil bacterial community were obviously related to native plant growth in those tow soils.

As a first step in better understanding the ecology and evolution of this invasive planarian, we studied its reproductive traits in populations across its extensive geographic range and conducted an experiment on the effects of food availability. Colonization by B. adventitium is facilitated by hermaphroditism, sperm storage, and tough egg capsules containing multiple offspring, traits present in most Terricola. The egg capsules produced by B. adventitium were large (22.5 mg), hatched in 7-37 days (mean = 23 days), contained 1-8 offspring (mean = 3.4), and represented about 21% of a parent's predeposition mass. Many individuals produced multiple egg capsules. Although considerable intraspecific variation was detected for most reproductive parameters, significant differences among geographic populations were noted for egg capsule mass, mean offspring mass, and measures of total reproductive output. Intraspecific correlations between parent mass and the masses of egg capsules and offspring, and the results of our experiment showing that food availability affected egg capsule production, together suggest that thus far intra-population variation and plasticity have been more important than local evolutionary adaptation in the invasion of this species.

Following optimal defence theory, which assumes a trade-off between herbivore resistance and plant growth, some have predicted that the success of invasive species could be the result of the evolution of lower resistance to herbivores and increased allocation of resources to growth and reproduction. Lack of evidence for ubiquitous costs of producing plant toxins, and the recognition that invasive species may escape specialist, but not generalist enemies, has led to a new prediction: invasive species may escape ecological trade-offs associated with specialist herbivores, and evolve increased, rather than decreased, production of defensive compounds that are effective at deterring generalist herbivores in the introduced range. We tested the performance of two generalist lepidopteran herbivores, Trichoplusia ni and Orgyia vetusta, when raised on diets of native and invasive populations of the California poppy, Eschscholzia californica. Pupae of T ni were significantly larger when reared on native populations. Similarly, caterpillars of O. vetusta performed significantly better when raised on native populations, indicating that invasive populations of the California poppy are more resistant to herbivores than native populations.

(coltsfoot) in Gros Morne National Park (GMNP) Newfoundland, Canada, was examined to determine which resource changes accompanying disturbance enabled population expansion. Resource levels reflecting environmental variables are defined here as the abiotic components of the environment used by plants. The environmental variables of pH, soil moisture, soil type, duff cover and photosynthetically active radiation were measured in 17 disturbance types of natural and anthropogenic origin - notably hiking trails, roads, gravel quarries, shorelines, slopes, hydro corridors, and forests killed by spruce budworm - and across a gradient from disturbed to undisturbed in 12 vegetation types. Balsam fir forest comprises 36% of the park and has the highest number of disturbance types. Disturbances favoring Tussilago were characterized by a pH of 6.8-8.3, high light intensity, increased bare ground, absence of duff cover, and moist, gravelly substrates. These levels were typical of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances in which the canopy and duff cover were absent, and the pH of acidic native soils had been raised by the addition of quarried limestone or granitic gravel. The difference in resource levels across the disturbance gradient indicates that Tussilago is unable to colonize undisturbed native vegetation. Likewise, a change in resource levels over time, which favors other species and is unsuitable for Tussilago, appears to be the mechanism of Tussilago's recession. Not all disturbance types present resource levels favorable for Tussilago establishment. However, resource levels associated with some disturbance types of anthropogenic origin indicate that aggregate quarry management practices have unintentionally enabled the invasion of Tussilago in GMNP Control of invasive vegetation can be addressed by identifying disturbance-related plant resource shifts that may have been caused by policies and procedures under local control.",Web of Science,Tussilago farfara,Canada,Newfoundland,Gros Morne National Park,49.59,-57.75,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Coniferous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Here, we present a test of the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis, which holds that because specialized natural enemies may be absent from the introduced range, exotic plants may evolve to invest less in anti-herbivore defenses and thereby gain a competitive advantage over native plants. We grew Solidago gigantea plants derived from both the native range (North America) and the invasive range (Europe) in a common garden in the native range for 2 years. Half the plants were treated with insecticide to protect them from insect herbivores and the other half were exposed to insects that colonized the garden from nearby fields. Insect herbivore biomass was significantly higher on European plants than US plants in the first year but not the second. European plants were more heavily attacked by pathogens in both years of the study. When exposed to insect herbivores, US plants produced more seed than European plants, but when plants were protected from herbivores, seed production was equivalent between US plants and European plants. The presence of insect herbivores suppressed seed production of European plants much more than that of US plants, even though the level of herbivory experienced by European and US plants was similar in the second year, suggesting that the ability to tolerate herbivory was diminished in European plants. These results partially support the EICA hypothesis: plants from the introduced range were more susceptible to some natural enemies and benefited more from insect removal than plants from the native range.

The altered disturbance regime in plant communities along corridor edges and vehicle traffic facilitate the spread and establishment of invasive non-native plant species. We compared the frequency of non-native plant species along highways and railways and the ability of these species to invade grasslands and dense forests along these corridors. We measured the frequency of several non-native plant species along transects 0-150 In from the edge of highways and railways in grasslands and forests, as well as at control sites away from corridors. Both transportation corridors had higher frequency of non-native species than respective control sites. Grasslands had higher frequency of non-native species than forested habitats, but the frequency did not differ between the highways and the railways. The frequency of non-native species in grasslands along highways and railways was higher than at grassland control sites up to 150 In from the corridor edge, whereas the frequency in forested habitats along corridors was higher than at forested control sites up to only 10 In from the corridor edge. There was a significant decrease in the frequency of non-native species with increasing distance from both corridors in the forest, while grasslands showed no significant change in non-native species frequency with distance from corridors. This suggests that corridor edges and grassland habitats act as microhabitats for non-native species and are more prone to invasion than forests, especially if disturbed. Our results emphasize the importance of minimizing the disturbance of adjacent plant communities along highways and railways during construction and maintenance, particularly in grassland habitats and in areas sensitive to additional fragmentation and habitat loss.

Responses of C. taxifolia fragments to the different extents of burial and for different durations (2, 6, 17 days) were investigated in the laboratory. Once uncovered, fragments in all treatments began to grow, and by 92 days partially buried fragments were not significantly different from controls in terms of the numbers of stolon meristems or total stolon length. Fragments buried totally were severely affected, but nevertheless, 35% of the fragments survived total burial for 17 days, and began to recover slowly when the sediment was removed. C. taxifolia can, therefore, persist for long periods under sediments, meaning that, in areas where burial is likely, the actual distribution of the species may be underestimated. Moreover, any potential control technique needs to penetrate sediments to be totally effective. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Numbers of native and exotic species were positively correlated at large (50 m(2)) and small (10 m(2)) plot sizes, a trend that persisted when relationships to environmental gradients were controlled statistically. Both native and exotic species richness increased with soil pH and decreased along a gradient of increasing nitrate availability. Exotic species were restricted to the upper portion of the pH gradient and had individualistic responses to the availability of soil resources. These results are inconsistent with both the diversity-resistance and resource-enrichment hypotheses for invasibility.

We investigated five goldenrods that frequently co-occur within their native ranges in Pennsylvania USA old fields. We measured goldenrod abundances, soil textures, nutrients, pH, and moisture within 30 old fields, and determined biomass allocation and flower and seed traits for each goldenrod species at a common site. Ordination revealed that Solidago altissima and S. gigantea were associated with fields having circum-neutral soils, whereas Euthamia graminifolia and S. rugosa achieved their highest abundances on acidic soils. Soil clay content and moisture may be associated with a further separation of species as the abundance of S. altissima tended to be higher on well-drained soils while S. gigantea had a tendency to attain its highest abundances on moist soils that had relatively stable moisture levels over time. Euthamia was more likely to be abundant on clay-rich soils while S. rugosa was often associated with soils containing little clay. Solidago juncea tended to associate with droughty soils that underwent marked soil-moisture changes over time. The latter goldenrod had the greatest absolute and relative root mass, the least absolute and relative leaf mass, highest seed-reproductive allocation, and heaviest achenes.

Solidago gigantea, S. altissima, and Euthamia are invasive species across Europe. The species with the highest colonization rate across Europe, S. gigantea, allocated the most to reproduction in our study, while S. altissima, with the second highest colonization rate, was highly clonal producing the most rhizome mass.

Plantations are commonly bordered by native Eucalypt vegetation resulting in a high potential for invasion and providing an opportunity to study pine invasion processes within forest environments. In order to determine if Pinus radiata equally invades different dry Eucalypt woodland vegetation types, two areas in the upper Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia were surveyed. Similar levels of invasion were observed in both Eucalypt forest types. An average pine abundance of 55 individuals for the Eucalyptus oreades and Eucalyptus sieheri vegetation type and 49 individuals for the Eucalyptus mannifera and Eucalyptus dives vegetation type was recorded in 20 m by 20 m plots located 50 In from the plantation boundary. To characterise the spatial distribution of the pines, transects were placed perpendicular to the plantation edge. As expected pine numbers diminished with distance from the plantation, however, large reproductive pine trees were found up to 4 km from the seed source signifying long distance dispersal. Investigation of wildling pine response to fire suggests that it may not always be an appropriate management tool. Fire stimulated seed release from cones and resulted in high recruitment of seedlings around reproductive pines which were large enough to survive the burn. Infrequent fires at intervals greater than time to maturity will lead to increased pine densities and further spread into the native vegetation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we experimentally manipulated colony sizes of Argentine ants in the laboratory to assess whether Argentine ants were able to survive and compete for resources with a widespread, dominant native ant, Iridomyrmex'rufoniger'. The results showed that over 24 h, the proportions of Argentine ants that were alive, at baits, and at sugar water decreased significantly in the presence of Iridomyrmex. In addition, Argentine ant mortality increased over time, however, the proportion of the colony that was dead decreased with the largest colony size. Argentine ants were only able to overcome Iridomyrmex when their colony sizes were 5-10 times greater than those of the native ants.

On the south-east coast of Australia there are extensive infestations of the environmental weed bitou bush Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata. This exotic weed is highly invasive and persistent, yet little is known about its impacts and how it dominates coastal vegetation. 2. A field study was carried out with sites selected for having an area heavily invaded by C. monilifera and an uninvaded native shrubland area. The mass and components of the litterfall and ground litter layer were monitored and compared over 12 months. Nutrient analysis was performed on the abscised leaves and mature green leaves. Soil properties and nitrogen content were also examined. 3. There was a greater input of litter to the native areas (4800 &PLUSMN; 450 kg ha(-1)), which was highly seasonal, compared with the C. monilifera areas (1690 &PLUSMN; 150 kg ha(-1)). There was also a greater mass of litter on the ground in the native areas (9600 &PLUSMN; 560 kg ha(-1)) than C. monilifera areas (3750 &PLUSMN; 170 kg ha(-1)), probably as a result of the higher leaf fall rate and slow decomposition rate. 4. A large proportion of nutrients was withdrawn from the native (48-80%) and C. monilifera leaves (38-60%) before abscission. The litterfall was estimated to contain more than twice the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous within the native areas, because of the high leaf fall rate rather than a high nutrient content. 5. The total soil nitrogen was two to five times higher in the invaded areas (average 2570 &PLUSMN; 620 kg ha(-1)) than within the native areas (730 &PLUSMN; 90 kg ha(-1)). This was accompanied by an increase in ammonia content. The bulk density was lower in invaded areas, but there was no clear trend in the change in soil pH. 6. Synthesis and applications. The higher soil nitrogen beneath the weed infestations could increase the competitive superiority of C. monilifera directly by increasing growth rate, or indirectly by impairing the establishment of native species that are adapted to growing in nutrient-poor soils.

Mycorrhizal fungi radically alter competitive interactions between plants within natural communities, and a recent study has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi provide a substantial competitive advantage to spotted knapweed, Centaurea maculosa, a noxious perennial plant that has spread throughout much of the native prairie in the northwestern U. S. Here we present evidence that this advantage is potentially due to mycorrhizally mediated transfer of carbon from a native bunch-grass, Festuca idahoensis, to Centaurea. Centaurea maculosa, Festuca idahoensis (Idaho fescue, C-3), and Bouteloua gracilis (blue gramma, C-4) were grown in the greenhouse either alone or with Centaurea in an incomplete factorial design with and without AM fungi. Centaurea biomass was 87-168% greater in all treatments when mycorrhizae were present in the soil (P < 0.0001). However, Centaurea biomass was significantly higher in the treatment with both mycorrhizae and Festuca present together than in any other treatment combination (P < 0.0001). This high biomass was attained even though Centaurea photosynthetic rates were 14% lower when grown with Festuca and mycorrhizae together than when grown with Festuca without mycorrhizae. Neither biomass nor photosynthetic rates of Centaurea were affected by competition with the C-4 grass Bouteloua either with or without mycorrhizae. The stable isotope signature of Centaurea leaves grown with Festuca and mycorrhizae was more similar to that of Festuca, than when Centaurea was grown alone with mycorrhizae (P = 0.06), or with Festuca but without mycorrhizae (P = 0.09). This suggests that carbon was transferred from Festuca to the invasive weed. We estimated that carbon transferred from Festuca by mycorrhizae contributed up to 15% of the aboveground carbon in Centaurea plants. Our results indicate that carbon parasitism via AM soil fungi may be an important mechanism by which invasive plants out compete their neighbors, but that this interaction is highly species-specific.",Web of Science,Centaurea maculosa,USA,Montana,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

Evidence from protected areas,journal,OECOLOGIA,139,3,467,477,"Although biological invasion by alien species is a major contributor to loss of indigenous biological diversity, few studies have examined the susceptibility of the boreal biome to invasion. Based on studies of other ecosystems, we hypothesized that alien plants will be restricted to disturbed areas near human activity and will not be found in natural areas of boreal ecosystems in Gros Morne National Park (Canada), a protected area experiencing a wide range of disturbance regimes. The distribution of alien plants in the region was evaluated using surveys, and study sites were established in naturally and anthropogenically disturbed habitats that had been invaded. Within study sites, randomization tests evaluated the importance of disturbance to alien plant invasion by examining changes in environmental conditions and species abundance within various disturbance regimes, while the importance of site characteristics limiting the distribution of alien plants were examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Consistent with studies in a variety of biomes, areas of high disturbance and human activity had the greatest abundance of resources and the highest percentage of alien species. However, contrary to our hypothesis, natural areas of boreal ecosystems were found susceptible to alien plant invasion. Vegetation types vulnerable to invasion include forests, riparian areas, fens, and alpine meadows. Natural disturbance occurring in these vegetation types caused increases in bare ground and/or light availability facilitating alien plant invasion. Although high soil pH was associated with alien plants in these areas, disturbance was not found to cause changes in soil pH, suggesting susceptibility to invasion is pre-determined by bedrock geology or other factors influencing soil pH. Moose (Alces alces), a non-native herbivore, acts as the primary conduit for alien plant invasion in GMNP by dispersing propagules and creating or prolonging disturbance by trampling and browsing vegetation. The recurrent nature of disturbance within the boreal biome and its interaction with site conditions and herbivores enables alien plants to persist away from areas of high human activity. Managers of natural lands should monitor such interactions to decrease the invasion potential of alien plants.",Web of Science,Many,Canada,Newfoundland,Gros Morne National Park ,49.61,-57.72,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Such quantification is important to assessing risks and impacts of invasives. We quantified the effects of Lonicera maackii, an exotic shrub invasive in many eastern North American forests, on survival, growth, and reproduction of three perennial herbs: Allium burdickii, Thalictrum thalictroides , and Viola pubescens. We predicted that the spring ephemeral, A. burdickii , would be most impacted, due to early leaf expansion of L. maackii. Field experiments were carried out in two deciduous forest stands, one (Gregg's Woodlot, GW) disturbed and the other (Western Woods, WW) relatively undisturbed. In each stand, individual herbs were transplanted into a blocked design of 60 plots where L. maackii was present, absent, or removed, and monitored for 5 growing seasons. Lonicera maackii did not affect survival of transplants, but reduced growth and final size of individuals of all three species. For two of the species, A. burdickii and V. pubescens, L. maackii reduced the proportion of live plants flowering in both stands, and reduced the seed or fruit number per flowering individual in GW. For T. thalictroides the proportion flowering was not affected, but seed number per flowering plant was reduced by L. maackii in both stands. For all three species, cumulative seed production over the course of the study was reduced by L. maackii. Overall, effects on the spring ephemeral, A. burdickii, were similar to effects on the other herbs. Because mortality of these established individuals was not affected, short-term studies might conclude forest herbs are unaffected by invasive shrubs.

The general issue of how exotics respond to unfamiliar environments within their new range is not well understood. Phenotypic plasticity has historically been seen as the primary. mechanism enabling exotics to colonize large, environmentally diverse areas. However, new work indicates that exotics can evolve quickly, suggesting that contemporary evolution may be more important in invasion ecology than previously appreciated. To determine the influence of contemporary evolution; phenotypic plasticity, and founder effects in affecting phenotypic variation among introduced plants, we compared the size, fecundity, and leaf area of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) collected from native European and introduced western and central North American populations in common gardens in Washington, California, Spain, and Sweden. We also determined genetic relationships among these plants by examining variation in amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. There was substantial genetic variation among introduced populations and evidence for multiple introductions of H. perforatum into North America. Across common gardens introduced plants were neither universally larger nor more fecund than natives. However, within common gardens, both introduced and native populations exhibited significant latitudinally based clines in size and fecundity. Clines among introduced populations broadly converged with those among native populations. Introduced and native plants originating from northern latitudes generally outperformed those originating from southern latitudes when grown in northern latitude gardens of Washington and Sweden. Conversely, plants from southern latitudes performed best in southern gardens in Spain and California. Clinal patterns in leaf area, however, did not change between gardens; European and central North American plants from northern latitudes had larger leaves than plants from southern latitudes within these regions in both Washington and California, the two gardens where this trait was measured. Introduced plants did not always occur at similar latitudes as their most closely related native progenitor, indicating that pre-adaptation (i.e., climate matching) is unlikely to be the sole explanation for clinal patterns among introduced populations. Instead, results suggest that introduced plants are evolving adaptations to broad-scale environmental conditions in their introduced range.",Web of Science,Hypericum perforatum,USA,California; Washington,,41.43; 46.63,-122.25; -122.95 ,Garden,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

In two sites, one more acid than the other, we applied lime, urea, or a sawdust-sugar mix to replicate plots in established barberry populations. We predicted that the acid site would be pH or cation limited. while the less acid site was N limited, unless N availability was inherently higher before treatment.

Growth and survivorship of transplanted seedlings of introduced tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Muntingia calabura, Adenanthera pavonia, and Clausena excavata) were used to assess abiotic (light regime) and biotic resistance (herbivory) to invasion of rainforest on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). At four sites, seedlings were transplanted into the forest edge along roadside verges and into adjacent intact forest; half were caged to prevent access by the dominant seedling consumer, the red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis). Red crab densities did not differ between roadside and forest plots. Red crabs initially reduced survivorship of Leucaena in both edge and interior plots but virtually all seedlings in the forest interior were dead after 41 weeks. Survivorship of Muntingia was also initially reduced by crabs in the forest edge, but again, all but one seedling died by the end of the experiment. Seedlings of Adenanthera and Clausena fared much better overall, surviving well in both locations. Red crabs had no overall effect on Adenanthera survival but significantly reduced survival of Clausena in forest plots. For both species, seedling performance was greater in the forest edge than in the forest interior. Red crabs had no effect on height increment for either species; however. for Clausena, red crabs reduced seedling mass in the forest interior. Both Adenanthera and Clausena were able to persist in the intact forest. Clausena is now actively invading intact rainforest, but Adenanthera appears dispersal-limited. Resistance factors in intact forest appear hierarchical: biotic resistance afforded by land crabs can impede establishment of some plant invaders but seedling responses to abiotic factors (e.g., the light regime) largely overwhelm its effect. Together, these two community attributes are likely to restrict the range of plant invaders to a small suite of species that can successfully establish in intact rainforest on the island.

The ability of torpedograss to disperse and become established at different water depths was evaluated in a series of experimental pond studies. These studies revealed that fragments remain buoyant for extended periods and so facilitate the dispersal of torpedograss within the lake. If fragments become anchored to sediment that is either exposed or in shallow water, they can readily root and establish mature plants; Once established, torpedograss can thrive in depths of 75 cm or less and can survive prolonged exposure to flooding depths greater than I m. In this manner, low water periods can contribute to the dispersal and colonization pattern of torpedograss in the lake.

In the field, fungicide (Benomyl) reduced AM mycorrhizal colonization of C. maculosa roots by >80%. Fungicide did not significantly reduce non-AM fungi. When grown alone, the biomass of C. maculosa was not affected by the fungicide application. However, depending on the combination of native competitor and fungicide, C. maculosa biomass varied from 10-fold decreases to 1.9-fold increases. In untreated soils, C. maculosa grew larger in the presence of Festuca idahoensis or Koeleria cristata than when alone. When fungicide was applied these positive effects of Festuca and Koeleria on C. maculosa did not occur. A third native grass, Pseudoroegneria spicata, had much stronger competitive effects on C. maculosa than Festuca or Koeleria, and fungicide reduced the competitive effects of Pseudoroegneria.

We also conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the role of leaf litter mass and physical texture on seedling survival, growth, and allocation. In the understory of an invaded mixed hardwood forest, we measured seed input, seedling emergence with seed rain, and seedling emergence without seed rain. Mean seed rain was 168 seeds m(-2): mean seedling emergence was 107 m(-2), and there was a strong correlation between seed rain and seedling emergence. The ratio of seedlings to seed input (0.61) was close to the seed viability (0.66) leaving very few seeds to enter the seed bank. Seed bank germination under field conditions was low (1 seedling m(-2)). Soil cores were incubated in a greenhouse to determine seed bank viability, and germination from these soil cores did not occur. To determine how litter affects seedling establishment and growth, we measured seedling emergence and biomass allocation in a greenhouse experiment. Seeds were placed below intact and fragmented deciduous leaf litter in amounts ranging from zero to the equivalent of 16 Mg ha(-1). Seedling emergence was not affected by fragmented litter, but decreased to <20% as intact litter increased to 16 Mg ha(-1). Increasing litter resulted in greater allocation to hypocotyl and less to cotyledon and radicle, and this effect was greater in intact litter. C orbiculatus seedlings achieve emergence through forest floor litter through plasticity in allocation to hypocotyl growth. The low survival of C. orbiculatus in the seed bank suggests that eradication of seedling advance regeneration and adult plants prior to seed rain may be an effective control strategy.

The effect of species, sampling location, and site shape index on invasive plant density was investigated, as well as differences in heights of invasive plants in edge vs. interior sampling locations. Species, sampling location, and fragment shape index were significant factors influencing invasive plant density at study sites. Density for all three species ranged from 0 to 18 stems m(-2).

Some of the genetic differences that were apparent, such as greater allocation to stems and leaf area relative to whole plant biomass in Costa Rican genotypes and greater allocation to roots in Hawaiian genotypes, were contrary to predictions that genotypes from the introduced range would allocate more biomass to growth and less to storage than those from the native range.

Instead, we formulate a new ERCA (Evolutionary Reduced Competitive Ability) hypothesis: if there is less competition in the invasive range and competitive ability involves traits that have a fitness cost, then selection might act against it, thereby reducing intraspecific interactions too.",Web of Science,Alliaria petiolata,,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

Furthermore, experimental communities built from North American plant species are far more susceptible to invasion by C. diffusa than communities built from Eurasian species, regardless of the biogeographical origin of the soil biota. Sterilization of North American soils suppressed C. diffusa more than sterilization of Eurasian soils, indicating that North American soil biota may also promote invasion by C. diffusa.

1566,"DeWalt, SJ; Denslow, JS; Ickes, K",2004,Natural-enemy release facilitates habitat expansion of the invasive tropical shrub Clidemia hirta,journal,ECOLOGY,85,2,471,483,"Normative, invasive plant species often increase in growth, abundance, or habitat distribution in their introduced ranges. The enemy-release hypothesis, proposed to account for these changes, posits that herbivores and pathogens (natural enemies) limit growth or survival of plants in native areas, that natural enemies have less impact in the introduced than in the native range, and that the release from natural-enemy regulation in areas of introduction accounts in part for observed changes in plant abundance. We tested experimentally the enemy-release hypothesis with the invasive neotropical shrub Clidemia hirta (L.) D. Don (Melastomataceae). Clidentia hirta does not occur in forest in its native range but is a vigorous invader of tropical forest in its introduced range. Therefore, we tested the specific prediction that release from natural enemies has contributed to its expanded habitat distribution. We planted C. hirta into understory and open habitats where it is native (Costa Rica) and where it has been introduced (Hawaii) and applied pesticides to examine the effects of fungal pathogen and insect herbivore exclusion. In understory sites in Costa Rica, C. hirta survival increased by 12% if sprayed with insecticide, 19% with fungicide, and 41% with both insecticide and fungicide compared to control plants sprayed only with water. Exclusion of natural enemies had no effect on survival in open sites in Costa Rica or in either habitat in Hawaii. Fungicide application promoted relative growth rates of plants that survived to the end of the experiment in both habitats of Costa Rica but not in Hawaii, suggesting that fungal pathogens only limit growth of C. hirta where it is native. Galls, stem borers, weevils, and leaf rollers were prevalent in Costa Rica but absent in Hawaii. In addition, the standing percentage of leaf area missing on plants in the control (water only) treatment was five times greater on plants in Costa Rica than in Hawaii and did not differ between habitats. The results from this study suggest that significant effects of herbivores and fungal pathogens may be limited to particular habitats. For Clidemia hirta, its absence from forest understory in its native range likely results in part from the strong pressures of natural enemies. Its invasion into Hawaiian forests is apparently aided by a release from these herbivores and pathogens.",Web of Science,Clidemia hirta,United States; Costa Rica,Hawaii,,9.646093; 10.455258; 10.200461; 19.620987; 19.697676; 19.453094,-82.749091; -84.001994; -83.607559; -155.135422; -155.141144; -154.894581,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

The American signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, an invasive species widely introduced throughout Europe, is a major threat to native European crayfish species and is causing increasing concern because of its wide impact on aquatic ecosystems. 2. Whilst various control and management methods have been proposed, very little is known about the factors influencing dispersal and movements of signal crayfish. 3. Sixty-four adult signal crayfish (carapace length 31.9-63.8 mm) were radiotagged in upland rivers in northern England, during four periods. Tracking was carried out at two sites, a low-density establishing population and a high-density established population. Tracking was carried out at both sites concurrently during midsummer (June to August 2002), during late summer (August to September 2001) at the low-density population site and during autumn to winter (October to February 2000/01) at the high-density population site. 4. Maximum movement occurred during midsummer. Temperature appeared to be a major factor influencing the timing and extent of movements between tracking periods. 5. The frequency distribution of the maximum distance moved upstream and downstream by radiotagged crayfish showed an inverse power relationship. The median maximal upstream and downstream distances moved were 13.5 m (range 0-283 m) and 15 m (range 0-417 m), respectively. There was a significant difference between the distributions of upstream and downstream ranges, with greater distances moved downstream. 6. All downstream movements made by crayfish appeared to be active movements and not the result of passive movement during periods of high discharge. There was no apparent influence of size, sex or density on the amount of movement recorded. 7.

Introduced plants generally have lower generalist herbivore loads than native plants. Herbivores may be avoiding a potentially edible food source (Behavioural Constraint Hypothesis) or defences of introduced plants may be unusually toxic (Novel Defence Hypothesis). 2. To examine these hypotheses, acridid grasshoppers (Melanoplus angustipennis and Orphullela pelidna) were enclosed in a Texas grassland. Each enclosure contained native prairie vegetation and a seedling of either introduced Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) or native Celtis laevigata (hackberry). Sapium invades many ecosystems in the south-east U.S.A. Celtis seedlings also establish in these ecosystems. 3. Although grasshoppers usually feed sparingly on Sapium, in field enclosures they fed heavily on this introduced tree species, supporting a role for behavioural avoidance. In laboratory feeding trials, M. angustipennis grasshoppers preferred Sapium foliage over the foliage of three native tree species. In a greenhouse experiment, M. angustipennis individuals fed more on Sapium in prairie mesocosms if they were conditioned on Sapium. 4. In another field experiment with single seedlings in enclosures, grasshoppers consumed similar amounts of Sapium from its introduced (Texas, U.S.A.) and native (China) ranges, suggesting that Sapium may have been a suitable host plant since it was introduced.

This study documents evolutionary shifts in tolerance and performance following the invasion of fresh water by the predominantly estuarine and salt marsh copepod Eurytemora affinis. Common-garden experiments were performed on freshwater-invading (Lake Michigan) and ancestral saline (St. Lawrence marsh) populations to measure shifts in adult survival (at 0, 5, and 25 PSU), and survival during development and development time (both using full-sib clutches split across 0, 5, 15, and 25 PSU). Results showed clear evidence of heritable shifts in tolerance and performance associated with freshwater invasions. The freshwater population exhibited a gain in low-salinity tolerance and a reduction in high-salinity tolerance relative to the saline population, suggesting tradeoffs. These tradeoffs were supported by negative genetic correlations between survival at fresh (0 PSU) versus higher salinities. Mortality in response to salinity occurred primarily before metamorphosis, suggesting that selection in response to salinity had acted primarily on the early life-history stages. The freshwater population exhibited curious patterns of life-history evolution across salinities, relative to the saline population, of retarded development to metamorphosis but accelerated development from metamorphosis to adulthood. This pattern might reflect tradeoffs between development rate and survival in fresh water at the early life-history stages, but some other selective force acting on later life-history stages. Significant effects of clutch (genotype) and clutch-by-salinity interaction (G X E) on survival and development time in both populations indicated ample genetic variation as substrate for natural selection.

In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of a well-documented, invading population of Argentine ants in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in northern California to examine the dispersal distances of reproductives, the direction and mode of population expansion, and changes in the genetic differentiation among nests over time. Using microsatellite data, we measure both traditional F-ST statistics and multi-locus genotype assignment distances to determine the patterns of genetic structure at three spatial scales: population-wide gene flow, population substructure, and mixing between neigh-boring nests. At the population level, there was little viscosity across the Jasper Ridge population, suggesting recent rapid expansion and/or considerable long-distance gene flow, presumably mediated by winged males. The pattern of genetic structure across distance indicates that the scale of queen dispersal was limited to less than 100 m. At the level of population substructure, hierarchical F statistics measures were low across subpopulations, locations within subpopulations, and nests. However, multi-locus genotype assignment tests revealed significant structure between subpopulations and between locations. Genetic distances between nests were lower within locations than between locations, indicating that nests are most closely related to neighboring nests and that the expansion of subpopulations is primarily due to the local budding of new nests from existing nests at the invasion front. At the level of nest connectivity, the genetic differentiation among neighboring nests was associated with the time since invasion.

Our results show that the genetic structure of nests was not homogenous across unicolonial populations.

Because invasions in protected areas are a product of complex processes occurring over a broad range of scales, we argue that a multi-scale research approach is needed to capture both patterns and potential mechanisms of the invasion process. Mapping L. vulgaris at the landscape scale, we found the species occupying a broad range of sites, apparently originating from just 2 historical sources, colonizing both human-caused and natural disturbances. Analyzed at the stand scale, patches tend to aggregate in newly invaded areas and disperse in heavily infested areas. The data suggest that patches grow in size by clonal growth and in number by creation of new satellite patches. Radial patch growth rates are related to site characteristics. Clonal patch scale analysis shows that ramet densities and Linaria's effects on native plants are highest in patch centers. Both mean ramet height and reproductive vs. vegetative ramet height ratio are higher in patch cores. These results suggest that L. vulgaris may displace natural vegetation by maintaining vigor even in large and old clonal patches. Our results confirm that L. vulgaris is a significant threat to native biodiversity in open, human- or naturally disturbed environments in protected areas of the Rocky Mountains.

The probability that a caterpillar species colonised alien Piper increased with its host range from 3% for the species feeding on a single plant family to 92% for the species with host range >10 plant families. 4.

In a preference experiment, Argentine ant workers showed a significantly greater propensity than Iridomyrmex to locate themselves in containers with the highest relative humidity.

Here we present evidence showing that the invasion of black cherry (Prunus serotina) into north-western Europe is facilitated by the soil community. In the native range in the USA, the soil community that develops near black cherry inhibits the establishment of neighbouring conspecifics and reduces seedling performance in the greenhouse.

It is predicted that increasing soil nitrogen availability will accelerate invasion of trees by stimulating their growth more than that of herbaceous species. Decreasing light availability is predicted to increase tree invasion by limiting the growth of herbaceous vegetation more than that of trees (competitive release). 2 We tested these predictions using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an aggressive alien invader of grasslands in the southern USA, and Hackberry (Celtis laevigata), which is a native tree common in these grasslands. 3 Nitrogen and light were manipulated in two factorial field experiments in grasslands in Texas, USA. In the first, nitrogen was increased and light was decreased in plots with planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings. In the second experiment, light availability to planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings was increased by holding back prairie vegetation. 4 In the first experiment, growth of Celtis and Sapium seedlings increased with nitrogen fertilization while the above-ground biomass of prairie vegetation did not change. Prairie vegetation biomass decreased and tree seedling growth increased under shading. Sapium's growth increased dramatically in the treatment with combined nitrogen and shade. Sapium survival decreased when shade was applied. 5 In the second experiment, Sapium growth increased with increased light. Thus, increased Sapium growth at low light levels in the shade experiment was probably a consequence of decreased competitive interference from prairie vegetation, rather than better absolute performance of Sapium in low light levels. 6 These results provide evidence for facilitation as a mechanism involved in tree invasions of grasslands. Changes in resource levels, perhaps in combination with other factors, may explain rapid conversion of grassland communities to woodlands after the first pioneer trees are established. The marked response of Sapium to the combination of nitrogen and shade suggests that these positive feedbacks may be particularly strong for this alien plant species.",Web of Science,Sapium sebiferum,U.S.A.,Texas,The University of Houston Coastal Centre,29.3833,-95.0408,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation;Disturbance,,primary

The balance of predation between closely related invasive and native species can be an important determinant of the success or failure of biological invasions. In Irish freshwaters, the introduced amphipod Gammarus pulex has replaced the native G. duebeni celticus, possibly through differential mutual intraguild predation (IGP). Theoretically, parasitism could mediate such predation and hence the invasion outcome. However, this idea remains poorly studied. 2. In a field survey, we show that the acanthocephalan parasite Echinorynchus truttae is present in more G. pulex populations than G. d. celticus populations. In addition, within parasitised populations, E. truttae is more prevalent in the invader than in the native. 3. We show for the first time that an acanthocephalan parasite mediates predation between its intermediate macroinvertebrate hosts. In a field experiment, E. truttae parasitism of the invader lowered IGP upon the unparasitised native. In laboratory experiments, parasitism of G. pulex significantly reduced their predatory impact on recently moulted female G. d. celticus. Parasitism also appeared to cause reduction in predatory behaviour, such as attacks per contact on precopula guarded female natives. 4.

In order to document the population structure that has developed since that time, collections were made from 56 local populations distributed among 9 geographical regions in eastern North America. Individual plants were characterized for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotype by restriction fragment size analysis of four noncoding regions of cpDNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. A total of 19 cpDNA haplotypes were detected using this method. The overall gene diversity of 0.85 is quite similar to the diversity detected in these same regions of cpDNA in a previously published sample of S. vulgaris taken from across much of Europe. The spatial distribution of the North American cpDNA diversity was quantified by hierarchical F-statistics that partitioned the genetic variance into variation among local populations within regions, and variation among regions. The average F-ST among populations within regions was 0.66 and the F-ST among regions was 0.09. The among-region variation was due to both differences among regions in the frequency of two most common haplotypes, and to the presence of a number of region-specific haplotypes. In order to test for isolation by distance at the regional level, F-ST values were calculated for all possible pairs of regions, and regressed against the geographical distance between those regions. There was no evidence for isolation by distance.

S. inaequidens would therefore be an economic and ecological problem if it became established and abundant in natural or farmed grassland ecosystems. We conducted field experiments using a split-plot design to determine the effects of rabbit grazing, interspecific plant competition, mollusc and insect herbivory on growth, survival and reproduction of S. inaequidens. Plants were grown from seeds of three different ecotypes under standardized greenhouse conditions and transplanted into field plots. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) were excluded from experimental plots using rabbit fences. Competition was manipulated by either creating subplots with bare ground or leaving the vegetation cover intact. Data were recorded between June and August 2002. Ecotypes differed significantly in morphological parameters, and in their responses to invertebrate herbivory. Interspecific plant competition and rabbit grazing significantly reduced growth and reproduction of S. inaequidens. Regrowth shoots of S. inaequidens produced after rabbit grazing were not subsequently eaten by rabbits. Unpalatability of regrowth shoots may be attributable to changes in pyrrolizidine alkaloid composition with plant age. Mollusc herbivory significantly reduced the number of capitulae produced.

Results showed that introduced species represented a very high percentage of macroalgal abundance in all the habitats studied.

To assess the role of facilitation in the life cycle of O. variegata, we investigated the effect of chenopod shrubs on different life stages of the species by experimentally manipulating temperature, light, soil moisture and nutrient levels. Experimental results suggest that the reduction in light and temperature under shrubs, but not increased nutrient levels, are the main facilitative mechanisms for O. variegata. Temperatures above 30degreesC, which are more likely to occur on the soil surface of open areas than under shrubs, inhibited seed germination. Seedling survival at low watering frequency and the growth of established ramets were increased by 75-80% shade cloth. Ramets growing in full light contained a high concentration of anthocyanin pigments. One of the functions of these pigments is to absorb excess radiation, suggesting that O. variegata experiences radiation stress in full light. In the field O. variegata performed considerably better under Atriplex vesicaria Heward ex Benth. (Chenopodiaceae) or under 75-80% shade cloth than in full light. Monthly irrigation of 20 mm did not reduce this positive effect of the A. vesicaria canopy on O. variegata, suggesting that O. variegata is inhibited by high light intensities or temperatures, independent of water availability.

The interpretation of these results has been disputed recently and it was proposed that sampling effects were responsible for the observed decrease of invasibility with diversity. The experiments performed to date were not designed to adequately separate sampling from diversity effects. Using the establishment of native plant species in experimental plant communities as a model of invasibility, we show that the number of invaders decreased with increasing diversity. When the presence of particular species is included, their effects are dominant.

To better understand invasive plant performance in intact versus disturbed forest habitats, we compared survival, relative height growth rate, aboveground biomass allocation, and leaf area of alien and native woody seedlings. In replicated understory versus open treatment plots at two sites we planted three pairs of native and alien species that appear ecologically similar: sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides), arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum) and glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula), and silky dogwood (Corpus amomum) and autumn olive (Eleagnus umbellata). Seedlings were protected from deer browsing by open-topped cages made of chicken wire. Norway maple survival in open and understory environments was greater than that of sugar maple, and autumn olive survival in understory environments was greater than that of silky dogwood. The species differed in their responses to open versus understory environments in height growth, aboveground biomass and leaf area. The four shrub species grew faster in the open, with glossy buckthorn growing faster than the others, while the two tree species did not differ in growth between the environments. Leaf mass per unit leaf area was greater in the open than in the understory for all six species, but the difference did not vary among species. Arrow-wood, silky dogwood, and autumn olive decreased leaf area per unit biomass in the understory, but variation in survival among species was not related to maintenance of leaf area ratio. Among the six species, the increase in biomass from understory to open environments was negatively correlated with growing season survival in the understory. This apparent trade-off relationship applied equally to native and alien species, indicating that release from physiological constraints does not explain the success of the invasive species.

We sampled the absolute cover of native and alien plant species on two tourist islands (St. Simons Island and Jekyll Island) and on two protected National Wildlife Refuge Islands (Blackbeard Island and Wassaw Island). On each island, vegetation composition and environmental variables (soil properties and salt spray) were measured in two habitats that differed substantially in their degree of environmental stress, the more exposed primary dune and the more sheltered and inland maritime forest. Sites were further stratified within each habitat into areas that had different levels of human disturbance. Many alien species were present on all islands and the absolute cover of alien species was not significantly different among islands even though they varied substantially in their degree of accessibility and overall land use. Alien plant cover was appreciably greater in severely disturbed sites than in less disturbed sites on all islands and within both habitats. However, the difference between disturbance categories was much less pronounced in the primary dunes where human disturbance agents do not mitigate the harsh environmental conditions of this habitat (salt spray and saline soils). Alien plant abundance on the GSI is evidently more dependent upon the availability of disturbed ground than the degree of accessibility or overall island development. It appears that human disturbance increases alien cover in general, but in environments where the stress levels are not mitigated, human disturbance does little to foster alien invasions.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Georgia Sea Islands,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

The exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has recently invaded freshwater systems throughout the United States. Daphnia lumholtzi possesses extravagant head spines that are longer than those found on any other North American Daphnia. These spines are effective at reducing predation from many of the predators that are native to newly invaded habitats; however, they are plastic both in nature and in laboratory cultures. The purpose of this experiment was to better understand what environmental cues induce and maintain these effective predator-deterrent spines. We conducted life-table experiments on individual D. lumholtzi grown in water conditioned with an invertebrate insect predator, Chaoborus punctipennis, and water conditioned with a vertebrate fish predator, Lepomis macrochirus. 2. Daphnia lumholtzi exhibited morphological plasticity in response to kairomones released by both predators. However, direct exposure to predator kairomones during postembryonic development did not induce long spines in D. lumholtzi. In contrast, neonates produced from individuals exposed to Lepomis kairomones had significantly longer head and tail spines than neonates produced from control and Chaoborus individuals. These results suggest that there may be a maternal, or pre-embryonic, effect of kairomone exposure on spine development in D. lumholtzi. 3. Independent of these morphological shifts, D. lumholtzi also exhibited plasticity in life history characteristics in response to predator kairomones. For example, D. lumholtzi exhibited delayed reproduction in response to Chaoborus kairomones, and significantly more individuals produced resting eggs, or ephippia, in the presence of Lepomis kairomones.",Web of Science,Daphnia lumholtzi ,,,,,,Lab,lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,herbivore

Fire can remove blackbrush cover and possibly increase plant species richness and evenness. Fire also may increase the frequency and cover of alien annual grasses, thereby intensifying landscape flammability. We tested these predictions in unburned and burned (6-14 years postfire) blackbrush at 3 sites spanning the range of this vegetation type in the Mojave Desert. Species richness in unburned blackbrush was similar to published values for other vegetation types in western North America, but richness varied significantly among the 3 sites and 4 spatial scales (1, 10, 100, and 1000 m(2)). Richness values declined in order from annual forbs, woody perennials, herbaceous perennials, annual grasses, cacti, to perennial grasses. Fire reduced Coleogyne cover, thus boosting species evenness. In contrast, species richness decreased after burning, although the results varied among spatial scales. Total cover was unaffected by fire because cover of woody perennials decreased, while cover of annual forbs, annual grasses, herbaceous perennials, and perennial grasses increased. Native species richness and cover decreased, whereas alien richness and cover increased after burning, especially where the alien forb Erodium cicutarium was present.

Early populations in the USA, believed derived from temperate Japan, all possessed a photoperiodically inducible egg diapause, but a population from Brazil, of probable tropical origins, did not. Based on responses of geographic populations to a common short (10L:14D) day length, we demonstrate that the spread of A. albopictus in Florida from more temperate USA has been associated with a gradual loss of diapause, such that diapause incidence is now positively correlated with latitude in the southern USA. In Brazil, most populations tested 15 yr after the initial invasion show no evidence of diapause, except for three from the two southernmost states (>26degreesS), in which a small, but significant percentage of eggs from mothers exposed to short day lengths were dormant. Diapause reduction in the southern USA and diapause acquisition by A. albopictus in southern Brazil have not resulted in similar response levels at comparable latitudes in the two countries, in part because of genetic constraints of different founder populations from temperate and tropical origins and different selective regimes in the two invaded countries.",Web of Science,Aedes albopictus,USA; Brazil,Florida,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,predator

When Ardisia seedlings were grown singly in pots without competition, soil phosphorus concentration and light had no effect on seedling growth. Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR), however, were higher for seedlings inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi isolated from Ardisia roots than those inoculated with single-spore isolates and nonmycorrhizal controls. In the second experiment, an Ardisia seedling was grown in each pot in competition with another conspecific seedling or with a seedling of Prunus caroliniana, a native subcanopy tree. The identity of the competitor had little effect on seedling RGR of Ardisia, but LAR was significantly higher for seedlings in conspecific competition. Overall, Prunus seedlings had higher RGR than Ardisia, but RGR and survival of Prunus seedlings were significantly reduced in competition with Ardisia when mycorrhizal fungi were suppressed by benomyl.

To investigate this hypothesis, we transplanted seedlings of the invasive alien tree, Sapitan sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) and an ecologically similar native tree, Celtis laevigata (hackberry), into mesic forest, floodplain forest, and coastal prairie sites in east Texas and manipulated foliar fungal diseases and insect herbivores with fungicidal and insecticidal sprays. As predicted by the Enemies Hypothesis, insect herbivores caused significantly greater damage to untreated Celtis seedlings than to untreated Sapium seedlings. However, contrary to predictions, suppression of insect herbivores caused significantly greater increases in survivorship and growth of Sapium seedlings compared to Celtis seedlings. Regressions suggested that Sapium seedlings compensate for damage in the first year but that this greatly increases the risk of mortality in subsequent years. Fungal diseases had no effects on seedling survival or growth. The Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis predicts that the local abundance of a species will depend more on local seed input than on competitive ability at that location. To investigate this hypothesis, we added seeds of Celtis and Sapitan on and off of artificial soil disturbances at all three sites. Adding seeds increased the density of Celtis seedlings and sometimes Sapitan seedlings, with soil disturbance only affecting density of Celtis. Together the results of these experiments suggest that the success of Sapium may depend on high rates of seed input into these ecosystems and high growth potential. as well as performance advantages of seedlings caused by low rates of herbivory.",Web of Science,Sapitan sebiferum,USA,Texas,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

We used data from surveys in 1958 and 1999 of the macroinvertebrates of Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, to assess changes in the distribution of native and introduced amphipods in relation to the wider assemblage. In 1958, the invader G. tigrinus dominated the shoreline fauna, with the native G. d. celticus present in very low numbers, whereas in 1999 the reverse was evident. In both surveys, G. tigrinus was the only amphipod present in the mid-Lough. G. tigrinus thus seems to have become established within L. Neagh, perhaps overshot and then senesced, with the native species re-establishing on the shoreline, with the invader mostly restricted to the deep mid-Lough. The non-amphipod macroinvertebrate assemblage was similar between the two surveys, in terms of Bray-Curtis community similarity, assemblage diversity, dominance and the taxa based ASPT water quality index. However, the mean density of macroinvertebrates (all taxa combined) was lower in 1999 compared to 1958, largely accounted for by a decline in oligochaete numbers. Since Gammarus species may be predators of other macroinvertebrates and influence their distribution and abundance, we investigated this trophic link in staged laboratory encounters. Both G. tigrinus and G. d. celticus preyed on isopods, alderflies, mayflies, chironomids and mysids, however, the native G. d. celticus had a significantly greater predatory impact on isopods and chironomids than did the invader G. tigrinus.

We mapped the locations, patterns of abundance, and ages of saltcedar along the Musselshell River and Fort Peck Reservoir in northeastern Montana to identify concentrations of plants that could be used to infer introduction location, establishment year, and mechanisms of dispersal. We estimated the presence of 24,500 plants on the Musselshell River over a river distance of 240 km, with concentrations at three nodes close to Roundup (2,000 plants, seedlings to 24 years), Melstone' (6,000 plants, seedlings to 23 years), and the mouth of the river at Fort Peck Reservoir (10,000 plants, seedlings to at least 11 years). Concentrations at Roundup and Melstone probably originated from urban plantings in the 1960s. The third concentration may have established from seeds and plant pieces washed downriver during floods and deposited in the hydraulic backwater of the Musselshell River delta at Fort Peck Reservoir. We believe there may be one-half to one million plants on Fort Peck Reservoir, with concentration nodes at recreation areas on the south shore. We estimated 3,500 mature saltcedar to be present at the Devils Creek Recreation Area, more than 11,000 plants at Hell Creek Recreation Area, and more than 40,000 plants at 6 sites at the south end of Dry Arm close to the Nelson Creek Recreation Area and mouth of Big Dry Creek. The oldest plants on the reservoir were 21 to 33 years old in 2001. Based on these ages, we suggest that saltcedar arrived at the south shore of Fort Peck Reservoir in the mid- to late 1960s, which means that it must have dispersed from the Bighorn/Yellowstone River system soon after it became established in southern Montana. Although wind dispersal and ornamental plantings cannot be ruled out as primary transport mechanisms to the reservoir, the concentrations and ages of saltcedar at recreation areas suggest that seeds and other plant propagules were also transported to the reservoir by earth-moving equipment during site construction between 1966 and the mid-1980s and later by boats and their towing vehicles. Saltcedar was dispersed away from these nodes by wind and water.

However, the role of parasites in the process of biological invasion is less well understood and mechanisms of parasite mediation of predation among hosts are unclear. Mutual predation between native and invading species is an important factor in determining the outcome of invasions in freshwater amphipod communities. Here, we show that parasites mediate mutual intraguild predation among native and invading species and may thereby facilitate the invasion process. We find that the native amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus is host to a microsporidian parasite, Pleistophora sp. (new species), with a frequency of infection of 0-90%. However, the parasite does not infect three invading species, G. tigrinus, G. pulex and Crangonyx pseudogracilis. In field and laboratory manipulations, we show that the parasite exhibits cryptic virulence: the parasite does not affect host fitness in single-species populations, but virulence becomes apparent when the native and invading species interact. That is, infection has no direct effect on G. d. celticus survivorship, size or fecundity; however, in mixed-species experiments, parasitized natives show a reduced capacity to prey on the smaller invading species and are more likely to be preyed upon by the largest invading species.

Three hybrid zones between the invasive and native species were located in the Ruhr Valley (Mulheim) and at the River Main near Wurzburg (Randersacker, Winterhausen). In each hybrid zone hybridization was indicated by additivity of region-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism markers proving independent hybridization events. The hybrids were either morphologically intermediate (R. x armoracioides) or were close to R. sylvestris. The trn L intron of R. austriaca is characterized by a species-specific deletion. This diagnostic chloroplast marker of R. austriaca was detected in three individuals of R. sylvestris providing evidence for introgression of the invasive chloroplast into the native species. Bidirectional introgression of R. austriaca markers into R. sylvestris and of R. sylvestris markers into R. austriaca was detected in the amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Some of the invasive R. austriaca populations showed high within-population variation. A possible association among introgression, within-population variation and invasion success is discussed. The morphologically intermediate hybrid R. x armoracioides is currently spreading in northern Germany. It forms large populations without its parent species R. austriaca and R. sylvestris. It is concluded that hybridization between invasive R. austriaca and native R. sylvestris may lead to the evolution of a new invasive species R. x armoracioides.",Web of Science,Rorippa austriaca,Germany,Mulheim; Wurzburg,River Main; Ruhr Valley,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,primary

The hermaphroditic gastropod Crepidula fornicata (L.) is a successful marine invader of European coasts. In France, it was first recorded in the 1940s and now proliferates, competing with cultured and fished bivalves. To analyze the patterns of spread and the genetic architecture of the Populations of this invader, 13 p0opulations, 12 French and 1 native (American) (N = 660) were sexed and analyzed using 8 polymorphic enzyme loci. The majority of the Populations showed balanced sex ratios. A high level of genetic diversity was detected in the French populations, contrary to the usual pattern of founder effect frequently reported for invaders. Moreover, most of the introduced populations were shown to be in migration-drift equilibrium. Thus, our results suggest that, in its introduced range, C. fornicata has stable populations and behaves genetically and demographically in the same way that it does over its native range. The pattern among French populations suggests that the introduction process was complex, and that C. fornicata from France derives from several genetically diverse, but poorly differentiated, source populations. Finally, this dataset also showed that the effects of shell-farmer-mediated transport between bays are only detectable at some specific localities. On the other hand, there was a good fit between patterns of genetic differentiation and the Major hydrodynamic features along the French coasts, strongly suggesting that larval dispersal plays an important role in the spread of C. fornicata in Europe.",Web of Science,Crepidula fornicata,France,,,,,Field - Observational,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,herbivore

Nor is much known about variation in invader behaviour in response to changing composition of the dominant native species in the recipient habitats. In the middle Main valley near Wurzburg (Germany), two invasive Brassicaceae forbs, Bunias orientalis and Rorippa austriaca, are frequently associated with a small number of dominant native species in the herbaceous vegetation of productive, disturbed sites. Variation in the relative dominance of these species suggests high variability between sites in the factors influencing the local invasion process. In our study, we examined variation in regeneration mode, type and frequency of disturbance, and native species composition, and considered life history differences between the two invasive species as factors contributing to the distinct dominance patterns. These factors were tested in a controlled field experiment in which individuals of the two invasive species and four native species were grown in mixed stands for almost 3 years. The development of the plants was monitored by cover values and all plants were harvested at the end of the study. All factors investigated contributed considerably to the development of distinct dominance patterns in the species mixtures. Relative to the natives, both invasive species were promoted by regeneration from vegetative fragments as compared to development from sexual offspring. While both invasive species were generally promoted by disturbance relative to the natives, they differed in their response to distinct types of disturbance, and these differences were strongly affected by species composition. Our results indicate that invasion success of R. austriaca may depend more on soil disturbance, soil transport and deposition, while B. orientalis is expected to particularly expand at mown sites that do not have dense cover by meadow grasses. Whether the native resident vegetation is mainly composed of successional competitors that suffer from disturbance or of ruderal competitors that compete early and strongly with the invasive species may be of critical importance for invasion by the two species.",Web of Science,Bunias orientalis; Rorippa austriaca,Germany,,Wurzburg ,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

This study was conducted to test the effect of nitrogen availability on competition between two grass species with contrasting life histories, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a North American exotic, and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), a North American native. We investigated the effects of nitrogen availability and competition on aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, height, and % nitrogen tissue concentrations by growing the two species in the greenhouse under five levels of nitrogen and six levels of competition. Nitrogen availability affected competition between Bromus tectorum and Bouteloua gracilis. At the lowest level of N availability, neither species was affected by competition. As N availability increased, aboveground biomass gain of Bromus was more negatively affected by intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition while the opposite occurred for Bouteloua. At the competition level at which each species gained the most aboveground biomass, Bromus had a linear response to increasing N availability while the response of Bouteloua was asymptotic.

When grown alone, aboveground biomass was similar for the two species, but Phalaris produced twice the stem length of Spartina via its low tissue density. Per unit biomass, Phalaris distributed its leaves over a larger canopy volume. Flooding reduced belowground biomass and increased total shoot length and shoot: root biomass of each species. Phalaris produced the most biomass, shoots, and total shoot length when wetter and drier conditions alternated weekly, while Spartina grew best with prolonged (4-week) inundation. When grown with Spartina, Phalaris changed its morphology by increasing its total shoot length: biomass ratio by 50%. However, ratios of Spartina: Phalaris aboveground biomass, shoot number, and total shoot length in two-species pots were not significantly affected by water depth or hydroperiod.

This paper examines the effect that a dominant introduced species, Carrichtera annua, has upon the winter annual community in the arid chenopod shrublands of South Australia. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to assess plant community response to changing below-ground resource levels and to the manipulation of the density of C. annua. Changes in the density of C. annua had little effect on the abundance of all other species in the guild. Nutrient addition produced an increase in the biomass of the most abundant native species, Crassula colorata. An analysis of the root distribution of the main species suggested that the areas of soil resource capture of C. annua and C. colorata are largely segregated. Our results suggest that intraspecific competition may be stronger than interspecific competition, controlling the species responses to increased resource availability. The results are consistent with a two-phase resource dynamics systems, with pulses of high resource availability triggering growth, followed by pulses of stress. Smaller plants were nutrient limited under natural field conditions, suggesting that stress experienced during long interpulse phases may override competitive effects after short pulse phases. The observed differences in root system structure will determine when plants of a different species are experiencing a pulse or an interpulse phase. We suggest that the limitations to plant recruitment and growth are the product of a complex interplay between the length and intensity of the pulse of resource availability, the duration and severity of the interpulse periods, and biological characters of the species.",Web of Science,Carrichtera annua,Australia,South australia,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Fluctuating Resources,,primary

Low herbivore loads due to costly resistance are generally assumed to give Sapium a competitive advantage over native plants.

We conducted full-factorial, paired greenhouse and field experiments designed to assess the effects of simulated leaf herbivory on Sapium growth in the presence of prairie vegetation at different levels of light and nitrogen. Contrary to our expectations, neither low-intensity, chronic defoliation nor high-intensity, acute defoliation negatively affected Sapium seedlings in any resource combination in either experiment.

Small gudgeons were generally associated with surface and benthic habitats, then restricted their distribution to benthic habitats at a size of approximately 24 mm ( standard length). The ontogenetic variation in mosquitofish habitat use was less discrete, and could be described as a tendency for larger individuals to be associated with the bottom of the littoral macrophyte beds than with the surface of the macrophyte beds or surface of the limnetic zone. Small gudgeons exhibited high spatial overlap with mosquitofish within the surface habitats of the ponds. All size-class/species comparisons showed significant partitioning of food resources, however, the diets of small gudgeons and mosquitofish were very similar.

In this study we related the large-scale distribution of the invading New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum ) in southern Victorian streams, Australia, to anthropogenic land use, flow variability, water quality and distance from the site to the sea along the stream channel. 3. The presence of P. antipodarum was positively related to an index of flow-driven disturbance, the coefficient of variability of mean daily flows for the year prior to the study. 4. Furthermore, we found that the invader was more likely to occur at sites with multiple land uses in the catchment, in the forms of grazing, forestry and anthropogenic developments (e.g. towns and dams), compared with sites with low-impact activities in the catchment. However, this relationship was confounded by a higher likelihood of finding this snail in lowland sites close to the sea. 5. We conclude that P. antipodarum could potentially be found worldwide at sites with similar ecological characteristics. We hypothesise that its success as an invader may be related to an ability to quickly re-colonise denuded areas and that population abundances may respond to increased food resources.

Evidently, the same mechanism was responsible for high richness of both native and alien species.

The experiment examined above-ground competition (by removing L. maackii shoots) and below-ground competition (by trenching around transplanted seedlings). The effects of above-ground competition with L. maackii were generally more important than below-ground competition, though both were detected. Shoot treatment was the key determinant for the survival of all species except P. serotina, whereas trenching only enhanced survival for A. saccharum caged and P. serotina, and only in the shoot removal treatment. For the surviving seedlings, L. maackii shoot removal increased growth of A. saccharum seedlings protected with cages, but actually reduced the growth of unprotected Q. rubra and A. saccharum seedlings, indicating that L. maackii shoots confer some protection from deer browsing. Significant interactions between root and shoot treatment on Q. rubra growth parameters, specifically greatest growth in the shoot present & trenched treatment, is attributed to protection from deer browsing combined with release from below-ground competition.

Deserts are one of the least invaded ecosystems by plants, possibly due to naturally low levels of soil nitrogen. Increased levels of soil nitrogen caused by atmospheric nitrogen deposition may increase the dominance of invasive alien plants and decrease the diversity of plant communities in desert regions, as it has in other ecosystems. Deserts should be particularly susceptible to even small increases in soil nitrogen levels because the ratio of increased nitrogen to plant biomass is higher compared with most other ecosystems. 2. The hypothesis that increased soil nitrogen will lead to increased dominance by alien plants and decreased plant species diversity was tested in field experiments using nitrogen additions at three sites in the in the Mojave Desert of western North America. 3. Responses of alien and native annual plants to soil nitrogen additions were measured in terms of density, biomass and species richness. Effects of nitrogen additions were evaluated during 2 years of contrasting rainfall and annual plant productivity. The rate of nitrogen addition was similar to published rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in urban areas adjacent to the Mojave Desert (3.2 g N m(-2) year(-1)). The dominant alien species included the grasses Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens and Schismus spp. (S. arabicus and S. barbatus) and the forb Erodium cicutarium . 4. Soil nitrogen addition increased the density and biomass of alien annual plants during both years, but decreased density, biomass and species richness of native species only during the year of highest annual plant productivity. The negative response of natives may have been due to increased competitive stress for soil water and other nutrients caused by the increased productivity of aliens. 5. The effects of nitrogen additions were significant at both ends of a natural nutrient gradient, beneath creosote bush Larrea tridentata canopies and in the interspaces between them, although responses varied among individual alien species. The positive effects of nitrogen addition were highest in the beneath-canopy for B. rubens and in interspaces for Schismus spp. and E. cicutarium. 6. The results indicated that increased levels of soil nitrogen from atmospheric nitrogen deposition or from other sources could increase the dominance of alien annual plants and possibly promote the invasion of new species in desert regions. Increased dominance by alien annuals may decrease the diversity of native annual plants, and increased biomass of alien annual grasses may also increase the frequency of fire. 7. Although nitrogen deposition cannot be controlled by local land managers, the managers need to understand its potential effects on plant communities and ecosystem properties, in particular how these effects may interact with land-use activities that can be managed at the local scale. These interactions are currently unknown, and hinder the ability of managers to make appropriate land-use decisions related to nitrogen deposition in desert ecosystems. 8. Synthesis and applications.

Using the modified-Whittaker plot design to sample understory species richness and cover, we collected data for 30 0.1 ha plots in each landscape. Topographic position greatly influenced results, while management history did not. At both Cheesman Lake and Turkey Creek, low/riparian plots had highest native and non-native species richness and cover; upland plots (especially east/west-facing, south-facing and flat, high plots) had the lowest. However, there were no significant differences between Cheesman Lake and Turkey Creek for native species richness, native species cover, non-native species richness' or non-native species cover for any topographic category. In general, non-native species richness and cover Were highly positively correlated with native species richness and/or cover (among other variables). In total, 16 non-native species were recorded at Cheesman Lake and Turkey Creek; none of the 16 non-native species were more common at one site than another. These findings suggest that: (1) areas that are high in native species diversity also contain more non-native species; (2) both protected and managed areas can be invaded by non-native plant species, and at similar intensities; and (3) logging, grazing, and other similar disturbances may have less of an impact on non-native species establishment and growth than topographic position (i.e., in lowland and riparian zones versus upland zones).

Little is known, however, about whether the presence of different AMF species leads to differences in plant community structure or invasion success by introduced species. To investigate the effects of AMF species on community structure and invasion, we created replicate microcosms containing soil inoculated with one of three different AMF species (Glomus spurcum Pfeiffer, Walker & Bloss, Scutellospora erythropa (Koske & Walker) Walker & Sanders, or Scutellospora verrucosa (Koske & Walker) Walker & Sanders) or a mixture of all three AMF species. Seeds of seven naturally co-occurring plant species (Ageratum conyzoides L., Cyperus compressus L., Chamaecrista nictitans (L.), Crotalaria incana L., Hyptis pectinata (L.) Poit., Sida rhombifolia L., Melinis repens (Willd.) Zizka) in Hawai'i were sown equally into these microcosms, which were placed on outdoor benches. Plant community development was monitored over a season. Mid-way through the experiment, an invader (Bidens pilosa L.) was added to the established communities to determine whether mycorrhizal species identity affected invasion success. Final aboveground and belowground phytomass were used to assess plant community differences among treatments. Although the identity of the dominant plant species (Melinis repens) remained the same in all treatments, community dominance, community productivity, plant species richness, Shannon index of diversity, and invasion success all varied with AMF species identity. Invasion success was not inversely related to species richness or diversity. Instead, increased richness, diversity, and invasion success all appeared to be related to decreased dominance by M. repens in the presence of certain AMF species. These results indicate that the composition of the AMF community belowground can influence the structure of the plant community aboveground, and may play a role in facilitating or repelling invasion.",Web of Science,Bidens pilosa,United States,Hawaii,,,,Lab,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

We hypothesized that populations of these summer-flowering Centaurea species must pass through a demographic gauntlet of survival and reproduction in order to persist and that the most invasive species (C. solstitialis) might possess unique life history characteristics. Using the idea of a demographic gauntlet as a conceptual framework, we compared each congener in terms of (1) seed germination and seedling establishment, (2) survival of rosettes subjected to competition from annual grasses, (3). subsequent growth and flowering in adult plants, and (4) variation in breeding system. Grazing and soil disturbance is thought to affect Centaurea establishment, growth, and reproduction, so we also explored differences among congeners in their response to clipping and to different sizes of soil disturbance. We found minimal differences among congeners,in either seed germination responses or seedling establishment and survival. In contrast,. differential growth responses of congeners to different sizes of canopy gaps led to large differences in adult size and fecundity. Canopy-gap size and clipping affected the fecundity of each species, but the most invasive species (C solstitialis) was unique in its strong positive response to combinations of clipping and canopy gaps. In addition, the phenology of C solstitialis allows this species to extend its growing season into the summer-a time when competition from winter annual vegetation for soil water is minimal. Surprisingly, C. solstitialis Was highly self-incompatible while the less invasive species were highly self-compatible. Our results suggest that the invasiveness of C. solstitialis. arises, in part, from its combined ability to persist in competition, with annual grasses and,its plastic growth and reproductive responses to open, disturbed habitat patches.",Web of Science,Centaurea solstitialis; Centaurea melitensis; Centaurea sulphurea,USA,California,Davis,,,Garden,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor;High Reprod.

Native dragonfly nymphs in Oregon, USA caused zero survival of bullfrog tadpoles in a replicated field experiment unless a non-native sunfish was present to reduce dragonfly density. This pattern was also evident in pond surveys where the best predictors of bullfrog abundance were the presence of non-native fish and bathymetry.

Corbiculidae have been accidentally introduced, during the first half of the twentieth century, in USA. They have since dispersed widely in the whole American continent. The introduction of Corbicula spp. to Europe dates from the 1980s. Some specimens were encountered in the mouth of the river Tage (in Portugal) and in the lower course of the river Dordogne (in France). During the 1990s, this species has been observed in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The taxonomic status of Corbicula species still remains uncertain in Europe. The polymorphism of Corbicula spp. has induced some researchers to see in the specimens collected from various rivers, different species or sub-species. In the present study, the authors describe and illustrate two different types, based on the morphology of the shell, which are assigned to the species C. fluminalis and C. fluminea. The historical background of this settlement in France shows that the spread of Corbicula spp. is extremely fast. After a first observation in 1980 in the lower Dordogne, this species has been successively discovered in 1985 in the river Garonne, then in the *canal du Midi* in 1989, in the river Loire in 1990, in the lateral canal to the river Garonne in 1993, in the river Rhin and in the river Moselle in 1994, and finally in the river Seine in 1997. The different steps of the invasion of the French hydrological network are analysed. In 1999, the colonization in progress in the river Seine prompted the authors to examine the spread of this bivalve mollusc through the hydrological bassin of the river Seine. The importance of navigation canals, linking up several rivers, in the mode of progression of this species could thus be revealed, particularly as the authors were also surveying the spread of the species in the river Loire at the same time. The rapid spread of Corbicula implies effective colonizing strategies in this invasive species which are discussed in a specific chapter. The impact of such an alien species on a weakened freshwater environment is also emphasised, since a fast expansion has ecological consequences for the physical environment and the local malacofauna.",Web of Science,Corbicula fluminalis; Corbicula fluminea,France,,,,,Field - Observational,lotic,,Impacts;Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,filter

Field surveys showed that the native Gammarus duebeni celticus dominates the shoreline of Lough Neagh, N. Ireland, with some co-occurrence with the N. American invader G. tigrinus. However, the latter species dominates the deeper areas of the mid-Lough. Transplant experiments showed no difference in survival of the native and invader in single species 'bioassay tubes' placed along the shoreline. However, there was significantly higher survival of the invader compared with the native in single species tubes placed in the mid-Lough. In mixed species tubes on the shoreline, the native killed and ate the invader, with no reciprocal interaction, leading to significant reductions of the invader. However, the invader had significantly higher survival than the native in mixed species tubes in the mid-Lough, with no evidence. of predation between the two species. These results indicate that, whereas differential intraguild predation may determine domination of the shoreline by the native, differential physico-chemical tolerances may be major determinants of the domination of the mid-Lough by the invader.

In this paper we first discuss why an evolutionary perspective can be helpful and outline a range of potentially useful approaches from population biology and ecological genetics. As a case study, we then ask how adaptation and genetic structure may promote or constrain the expansion of an invasive weed, Verbascum thapsus , into high elevations in the Sierra Nevada of California. We used growth-chamber and common-garden experiments to assay a range of morphological and physiological traits that could influence plant fitness at high elevation. There was a significant relationship between elevation and leaf size and reflectance above 800 m, although we found no relationship between elevation and most other traits ( growth rate in warm or cool temperatures, freezing tolerance when grown in warm or cool temperatures, leaf number, rosette morphology, plant height ). We did see marked genetic differentiation among populations, possibly reflecting founder effects and a history of genetic drift. When we partitioned the phenotypic variance, there was almost no variation among maternal families within populations, limiting the potential for selection to act. The majority of the variance for all traits was among individuals within families, suggesting that environmental conditions strongly influenced the phenotype.

The biotic resistance hypothesis argues that interactions with native species, including natural enemies, limit invaders' impacts(6-8). We tested these hypotheses for viruses and for rust, smut and powdery mildew fungi that infect 473 plant species naturalized to the United States from Europe. On average, 84% fewer fungi and 24% fewer virus species infect each plant species in its naturalized range than in its native range. In addition, invasive plant species that are more completely released from pathogens are more widely reported as harmful invaders of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Together, these results strongly support the enemy release hypothesis. Among noxious agricultural weeds, species accumulating more pathogens in their naturalized range are less widely noxious, supporting the biotic resistance hypothesis.

While these factors play a role in determining the potential for invasion. they are often inadequate in predicting the Success of a specific invasion. We show that interactions of an invasive grass with other members of the community determine the local pattern of invasion. A fungus, Ulocladium atrum, aids the establishment of barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis) by weakening the grass's tough seed head. thereby accelerating germination and seedling establishment. In contrast, gophers. Thomomys bottae, decrease establishment of this invader by selectively burying patches of goatgrass seedlings under mounds. Plants that survive these gopher disturbance produce seeds that are uninfected by Ulocladium atrum, which may further decrease the establishment of the next generation of goatgrass.

When immigration is enhanced by high propagule pressure or low-intensity disturbance, the relationship between diversity and exotic species invasion should be positive. Only when such immigration processes are limited should competitive interactions lead to a negative correlation between diversity and invasibility. Moreover, competition should be more apparent at smaller scales where individual plants compete directly for space; thus, diversity and invasibility are more likely to be negatively correlated at small spatial scales. We tested these predictions by comparing exotic and native species diversity of vascular plants across five spatial scales in riparian and upland plant communities in the southern Appalachians, We found a positive relationship between species diversity and exotic invasion in riparian areas at large scales (100 m(2)). Which graded into a negative relationship at small scales (0.01 m(2)). In uplands, there was a slight positive relationship between native and exotic species diversity at both scales of observation.

The Mediterranean area, zones at low altitudes, wetlands and coastal habitats are the most strongly affected by the invasions in France.

Polyploidy constitutes a very favourable attribute for the success of alien plants, above all for the patent invaders (P = 77%) and those that are widespread in France (P = 86%). The polyploid percentage increases with the difficulties of the colonization, overall and irrespective of the life-form, but specially in the groups that are naturally the most vulnerable (Thero- and Cryptophytes).

Shoreline plant communities of impoundments in the American Southwest often become dominated by mature, senescent Populus and Salix, with few if any seedlings. The failure of native plant community replacement is exacerbated by the fact that Tamarix, a prolific invader, is abundant on regulated rivers and occupies extensive areas along the shores of impoundments.

Higher survival and greater biomass under saturated but not flooded soil conditions demonstrated that both Salix and Tarnarix cuttings can prosper in soils within the exposed drawdown zone, provided that the shoots are not submerged. However, greater biomass of Tamarix under conditions favorable to the native Salix also indicates that Tainarix colonization will have to be controlled.

The effects of fungicide varied among species and sampling dates, but the recovery of natives was not consistently improved more than the recovery of exotics.

Northern ecotypes invested more in roots relative to southern ecotypes but only under low temperatures. Both ecotypes increased shoot investment in warm temperatures. Increased root investment in cold temperatures by northern ecotypes may increase their first winter survival.

We planted broom seedlings into the shrubland (control) and into three treatments: (1) resident shrubs removed, (2) tussocks removed and (3) shrubs and tussocks removed. We measured broom seedling mortality and growth over two growing seasons. The site was grazed by sheep in the first season, and scarcely grazed in the second, wetter season. Survivorship across all treatments after 19 months was 42%, and was lowest where shrubs were retained but tussocks removed. Broom seedlings grew taller and had greater leaf areas in treatments that retained shrubs. Neighbouring (within 49 cm) shrubs had no effects on survivorship or growth of broom seedlings. Neighbouring tussocks increased survivorship of broom seedlings but depressed their growth. Grazing by sheep was the most important determinant of survivorship and growth of broom seedlings, and effects were uniform regardless of experimental treatments. Initial high mortality of seedlings (48% in the first 3 months) was due to grazing, and height growth was often negative during periods of grazing. In the second growing season when the site was less grazed and there was greater rainfall, there was a rapid increase in height across all treatments.

For the three most abundant introduced species of ascidian (sea squirt), the timing of the initiation of recruitment was strongly negatively correlated with winter water temperature, indicating that invaders arrived earlier in the season in years with warmer winters. Total recruitment of introduced species during the following summer also was positively correlated with winter water temperature. In contrast, the magnitude of native ascidian recruitment was negatively correlated with winter temperature (more recruitment in colder years) and the timing of native recruitment was unaffected. In manipulative laboratory experiments, two introduced compound ascidians grew faster than a native species, but only at temperatures near the maximum observed in summer. These data suggest that the greatest effects of climate change on biotic communities may be due to changing maximum and minimum temperatures rather than annual means. By giving introduced species an earlier start, and increasing the magnitude of their growth and recruitment relative to natives, global warming may facilitate a shift to dominance by nonnative species, accelerating the homogenization of the global biota.",Web of Science,Ascidiella aspersa; Botrylloides violaceous; Diplosoma listerianum,USA,Connecticut,,,,Field - Observational,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,filter

This species, Guiera senegalensis (Combretaccae), has benefited from the elimination of other species thanks to its high resistance to the increasing cutting pressure for cultivation. We sought to identify traits of its life cycle that could contribute to its persistence and widespread dominance under such a disturbance regime. Leafing, flowering and fruiting were monitored on seven fallows differing in topographic location, age, shrub density and degradation state, during two rainy seasons and one dry season. Phenological spectra showed similar timing of the three phenophases of the seven populations. Differences were observed mainly in magnitude of the phases. However, there were both a high intra-fallow variability (64.6% of the whole variability) and a statistically significant inter-fallow variability, despite only 35.4% of the total variability being due to differences between fallows. A statistical classification of the fallows was proposed based on shrub phenological course over the two cycles monitored. This classification corresponds to a gradient of life-cycle achievement primarily linked to the topographic situation of the stations, and then to a combination of other factors. The flexibility of the phenology at the individual, population and metapopulation scales, inherent to its specific semi-evergreenness property, appeared as an essential phenological attribute contributing to successful widespread persistence of G. senegalensis in the study area.",Web of Science,Guiera senegalensis,Niger,,Sahelian fallow,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary

Plants of both species were sampled along the woodland edges of cedar glades and in the (primarily) redcedar forest at Stones River National Battlefield, Rutherford County, Tennessee, between March 2000 and February 2001. MANOVAs (Pless than or equal to0.05) indicated significant differences between species and habitats for several of the 23 traits measured in the study. Regardless of the habitat, L. sinense had a more treelike growth form-higher leaf area ratio (leafiness), leaf mass ratio (investment in leaf biomass), stem elongation rate, and number of fruits per ramet- and a lower percentage of insect-damaged leaves and leaf abscission rate than F. ligustrina. Height and leaf areas of L. sinense plants growing in the woods were greater than those of L. sinense plants growing along the glade and greater than those of F. ligustrina plants growing in both habitats. Branch architecture did not differ appreciably between the species.

This study concerns variation at 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci in 30 populations of Biomphalaria pfeifferi. The sampling area spans most of the species' range in Madagascar where it was probably introduced recently. Extremely low variation was found within all populations studied, which may partly result from high selfing rates. However, this cannot account for the variance of variation across populations, which is better explained by habitat openness (that reflects environmental stochasticity), the prevalence of the parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni and historical demography (colonization and subsequent bottlenecks). Large global differentiation was also observed, suggesting that current gene flow among populations is limited to small distances, within watersheds and to few individuals. Our data set also allowed us to test several hypotheses regarding colonization, based on bottleneck and admixture tests. The observed pattern requires at least two independent introductions from slightly differentiated genetic sources in the western part of Madagascar. Another introduction, from a very different genetic origin, should also be postulated to explain the genetic composition of eastern populations.

At the habitat level, the relationships between the invasive behaviour and a number of autecological, ecological and habitat variables were analysed by means of logistic analyses. In the best model five variables were related to alien plant invasions: climatic affinity, disturbance of the invaded habitat, route of introduction, soil moisture during summer, and life form. To elucidate the environmental factors that could be responsible for alien plant invasions at a regional scale, the number of alien taxa and the environmental features at 13 localities of the western Mediterranean area were analysed.

It is concluded that various specific environmental features - high mean temperatures, the abundance of riparian systems, the existence of biotopes with favourable water balance which harbour a great richness of alien species and the high human pressure to which the enclave is subjected, combined with the ecological requirements of the alien species and certain species attributes (biotype) can interact at different scales and have caused the over-representation of alien plants.",Web of Science,Many,Spain,Tarragona,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Disturbance,,primary

In support of previous studies, native species richness was the best single predictor of alien species richness, probably because it was a good estimator of both park area and habitat diversity available for establishment of alien species. Other significant predictors of alien species richness were years of occupation of the area by European settlers and the human population size of adjacent counties. Climate, visitation rate, road length and park shape did not influence alien species richness.

We tested the ability of nutrients (N and P) to increase vegetative growth of T. X glauca (a hybrid of T. latifolia and T. angustifolia). In the greenhouse, 17 treatments revealed that T. X glauca required both N and P for growth, and total leaf length was most stimulated where a higher proportion of P was added (7N:1P vs. 14N:1P, with N constant and P changed), regardless of concentration (the High treatment was 4X the Low treatment). In Gardner Marsh (Madison, Wisconsin, USA), we set up 28 plots (I X 6 m) that bisected the boundary between sedge meadow (graminoids) and T. X glauca, and we added a common lawn fertilizer (9N: 1P:4K) at high (62.5 g/m(2)), medium (31.3 g/m(2)), low (15.6 g/m(2)), and control (0 g/m(2)) rates on five dates, with n=7 plots/treatment. After one growing season, fertilizer addition increased T. X glauca ramet density, height, and biomass, especially where the sedge meadow graminoids were initially dominant. Aboveground biomass of T. X glauca in the high nutrient addition treatment (1029 +/- 256.1 g/m(2)) was more than double that for control plots (431 +/- 80.52 g/m(2)) overall, with the greatest percent increase in sedge meadow subplots. In contrast, native graminoids (mostly Carex spp.) did not respond to treatment, either in biomass or percent cover. Typha X glauca allocated nutrients to both growth and storage, as indicated by higher N and P concentrations in leaves, shoot bases, and rhizomes in plots with high nutrient addition. Because fertilizing the marsh enhanced the shoot growth of T. X glauca but not native graminoids, and because the 7N:1P treatment stimulated growth in the greenhouse, we suggest that wetland managers focus on reducing P inflows to urban wetlands.

The effective management of invasive plants requires an understanding of their invasiveness in contrasting environments. The effects of disturbance on recruitment of broom Cytisus scoparius, a European shrub invading parts of Australasia, was assessed in a 7-year experiment carried out in two countries, respectively, in its native and exotic ranges. This paper presents the results for Australia and their implications for the biological control of this weed. 2. Disturbance treatments involved removal (cut or cut plus cultivation) and grazing effects on broom seed banks and recruitment, in mature and immature stands and in three habitats, ranging from improved, largely exotic pasture to unimproved native grassland. 3. The time between recruitment and flowering varied between 5 and 7 years depending on habitat, the slowest being in native unimproved grassland. In cultivated plots, regeneration was faster in immature compared with mature broom stands. 4. Following broom removal, whether the ground was cultivated or not had little effect on the speed of regeneration, indicating weak suppression from the ground flora in uncultivated plots. In contrast, grazing tended to increase the rate of regeneration. 5. The timing of seedling establishment had little effect on survival to reproduction, in marked contrast to European populations. The overall rates of seedling mortality were greater in Australia compared with Europe. 6. A simulation model, parameterized from the field data, was used to explore the likely impact of biological control from pre-dispersal seed predation. 7. The simulation studies demonstrated large habitat-specific differences in seed rain requirement for broom persistence and the potential impact of seed predators. Seed rain requirements were fivefold less in improved exotic pasture vs. native grassland. Seed loss of 62% was theoretically sufficient to suppress broom in native grassland, whereas > 97% was required in exotic pasture. 8.

We tested the hypotheses that: (i) some types of microhabitats within a community are more invasible than others; (ii) microhabitat types that differ in invasion also differ in resource availability; and (iii) invasibility is mediated by effects of these resources on competition between native and non-native species. 2 To test the first two hypotheses, we measured plant cover and soils in a coastal grassland in northern California. Consistent with these hypotheses, cover of non-native plants was consistently high where nitrogen-fixing shrubs had recently grown, in the bottoms and sides of gullies and on deep soils, and these microhabitats tended to have relatively high nitrogen or water availability. 3 Cover and number of native species tended to be lower where cover of non-native species was higher, indicating that non-native species as a group negatively affected native species. However, the number of non-native species also tended to be lower where the total cover of non-natives was higher. This suggests that a few non-native species excluded natives and other non-natives alike. 4 To test the third hypothesis, we grew a common non-native, the annual grass Lolium multiflorum , and a common native, the perennial grass Hordeum brachyantherum , at different levels of water and nitrogen. The relative competitive ability of the native was higher at lower nitrogen availability but not at lower water availability. When 10-week-old native plants were grown with non-native seedlings and nitrogen was relatively low, the native out-competed the non-native. However, the non-native out-competed the native at all resource levels when species were both grown as seedlings. Competition between native and non-native grasses in this system may thus help prevent invasion by non-natives in microhabitats where nitrogen availability is low, but invasion may be relatively irreversible.",Web of Science,Lolium multiflorum,USA,California,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,primary

Surprisingly, this was mostly due to numbers increasing at lower densities, probably because microscopic forms were not removed during the experimental thinning. 3 The allometric length-dry mass relationship fitted a simple linear model on log-log scale for both the highest and the lowest densities, but had different slopes. At higher densities plants became taller and thinner as a consequence of variations in the production and growth of modules. 4 Mean size (dry mass) and the development of size hierarchies of plants were affected by both the addition of further (microscopic) recruits and asymmetrical competition among plants. Plant length distributions were also influenced by changes in the growth form of plants. The length hierarchies of main branches also suggested the presence of asymmetrical competition at this modular level. 5 Density influenced both mean size and morphology of the plants and thus induced changes in reproduction. The negative effect of density on individual plant size reduced the percentage of fertile plants and possibly their annual reproductive allocation, but these effects may be attenuated by morphological responses. 6 The responses of S. muticum to crowding are closely linked to its ability to colonize bare space.

Therefore, in this study, we used microcosm and mesocosm laboratory experiments, with both single and mixed prey species scenarios, to assess any predatory impact of D. villosus on a range of macro invertebrate taxa, trophic groups, and body sizes.

A detailed investigation of seed production was conducted at one of these populations in a secondary oak-hickory forest in Dixon Springs State Park, Illinois. In this park, M. vimineum occurs as a central, main population with several disjunct subpopulations. Size of flowering and non-flowering individuals was determined as the plants set seed. Seed dispersal was assessed using seed traps. A severe late summer drought impacted the Dixon Springs population in 1999 and few plants flowered. Plants that did flower were significantly larger than those not flowering and were limited to one small area at the edge of the core population. At Dixon Springs, the germinable seed bank was estimated from soil samples collected in Fall 1999 before flowering, and in the subsequent spring. Seedlings emerged from soils placed in a greenhouse from samples collected in the spring. No seedlings emerged from samples collected in the fall. Germinable seed had a 10 times higher density in samples collected near the soil surface than from samples collected at 5-10 cm depth. Seed dispersal occurred within the main population only. Despite the lack of seed dispersal in 1999, seedlings emerged from six of seven subpopulations in spring 2000, with the highest densities where plants had flowered in 1999. These data indicate the presence of a persistent soil seed bank for M. vimineum. Even following summer drought and discounting spring seedling emergence, the size of the seed bank increased by similar to25% in 1999. Reestablishment of the Dixon Springs population following the 1999 drought was vigorous, but the location of the largest, most fecund plants in 2000 was not the same as in 1999.

Roxb.) was assessed in forests and spoil areas of South Carolina and along forest edges in Louisiana during the 1997-99 fruiting seasons. Tallow trees in these floristically distinct habitats had a few common and many casual visitors, and considerable species overlap among habitats was found. However, bird species differed in the importance of dispersing and dropping seeds among habitats. Important dispersal agents common to forests and spoil areas of South Carolina included Northern Flicker, American Robin and Red-winged Blackbird, whereas Red-bellied Woodpecker and European Starling were important in the former and latter habitat, respectively. In Louisiana, Red-bellied Woodpecker, American Robin, Northern Cardinal and Eastern Bluebird dispersed many seeds. Nearly all species foraging on seeds were winter residents. Estimated numbers of seeds dispersed and dropped were higher in spoil areas of South Carolina than in Louisiana because of higher numbers of individuals per visit, higher seed consumption and seed dropping rates, and longer foraging durations. Within South Carolina, more seeds were dispersed and dropped in spoil areas than in forests because of higher numbers of birds per visit. These findings show that among habitats, tallow tree attracts diverse but variable coteries of dispersal agents that are qualitatively similar in seed usage patterns. We suggest that its generalized dispersal syndrome contributes to effective seed dispersal by many bird species throughout its range.

It is unclear, however, whether this relationship is robust across spatial scales, and how a disturbance regime may affect it. Here, I examine the relationships of both richness and abundance between native and naturalized species of plants in two mediterranean scrub communities: coastal sage scrub (CSS) in California and xeric-sloped matorral (XSM) in Chile. In each vegetation type I surveyed multiple sites, where I identified vascular plant species and estimated their relative cover. Herbaceous species richness was higher in XSM, while cover of woody species was higher in CSS, where woody species have a strong impact upon herbaceous species. As there were few naturalized species with a woody growth form, the analyses performed here relate primarily to herbaceous species. Relationships between the herbaceous cover of native and naturalized species were not significant in CSS, but were nearly significant in XSM. The herbaceous species richness of native and naturalized plants were not significantly correlated on sites that had burned less than one year prior to sampling in CSS, and too few sites were available to examine this relationship in XSM. In post 1-year burn sites, however, herbaceous richness of native and naturalized species were positively correlated in both CSS and XSM. This relationship occurred at all spatial scales, from 400 m(2) to 1 m(2) plots. The consistency of this relationship in this study, together with its reported occurrence in the literature, suggests that this relationship may be general. Finally, the residuals from the correlations between native and naturalized species richness and cover, when plotted against site age (i.e. time since the last fire), show that richness and cover of naturalized species are strongly favoured on recently burned sites in XSM; this suggests that herbaceous species native to Chile are relatively poorly adapted to fire.",Web of Science,Many,United States; Chile,California,,34.05;-33.0167,-118.2333;-71.6333,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

In one of the United States' worst invasions, Eurasian Tamarix plant species have spread rapidly to dominate over 600,000 riparian and wetland hectares. The largest Tamarix invasion consists of Tamarix chinensis and Tamarix ramosissima, two morphologically similar species. To clarify the identity, origins, and population structuring of this invasion, we analyzed DNA sequence data from an intron of a nuclear gene, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PepC). This intron proved to be highly variable at the population level, and the 269 native and invasive specimens yielded 58 haplotypes, from which we constructed a gene genealogy. Only four of these haplotypes were common to both the U.S. and Eurasia. Surprisingly, we found that the most common plant in this U.S. invasion is a hybrid combination of two species-specific genotypes that were geographically isolated in their native Eurasian range. Less extensive hybrids exist in the invasion, involving combinations of T. ramosissima and T. chinensis with Tamarix parviflora and Tamarix gallica. The presence of potentially novel hybrids in the U.S. illustrates how importation of exotics can alter population structures of species and contribute to invasions.",Web of Science,Tamarix chinensis; Tamarix ramosissima,United States; Iran; Republic of Georgia; Turkmenistan; Kazakstan,,,,,Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,primary

Understanding plant-soil relationships and competitive interactions of invasive weeds is crucial in long-term control strategies. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the influence of soil nutrient depletion on plant growth and plant competition between the exotic invasive weeds, Lepidium latifolium (invading wetlands) and Bromus tectorum (invading a multitude of habitats). Plants were grown individually and in combination until L. latifolium flowered, then roots and aboveground mass were harvested. Soil in individual pots was homogenized, subsamples collected for nutrient analyses, and the soil was re-planted to the same species, grown, and harvested twice more for a total of three growth cycles. As nutrient supplying capacity of the soil declined through growth cycles, aboveground mass of L. latifolium decreased significantly (Pless than or equal to0.05) and growth potential of B. tectorum surpassed that of L. latifolium. Only bicarbonate-extractable soil ortho-P positively correlated with plant mass of L. latifolium. A separate experiment demonstrated that L. latifolium has a narrow window of soil water potentials for optimal growth; greatest growth at -20 kPa with significantly declining growth at saturation and -400 kPa. Our data suggest that L. latifolium primarily invades wetlands because the high soil water content reduces tortuosity and allows efficient transport of nutrients to this sparsely rooted species. When soil moisture and/or the nutrient supplying capacity of the soil declines, plants with greater root density can out-compete L. latifolium.

The weed potential of A. baileyana was investigated in terms of its breeding system and seed production. It was found that the purple form is as reproductively efficient as the green form. Both forms were outcrossing, highly self-incompatible, grew very rapidly and flowered by two years of age. For open, natural pollination, final pod set was low-less than 0.41%. However, seed production was high due to the high number of flowers present. Maximum flower production for a 2-year-old plant was over 300 000, resulting in more than 8000 seeds. Precocity and high flower numbers appear to be the reasons for the weed status of A. baileyana.

The diversity resistance hypothesis, which argues that diverse communities are highly competitive and readily resist invasion(3-5), is supported by both theory(6) and experimental studies(7-14) conducted at small spatial scales. However, there is also convincing evidence that the relationship between the diversity of native and invading species is positive when measured at regional scales(3,11,15,16). Although this latter relationship may arise from extrinsic factors, such as resource heterogeneity, that covary with diversity of native and invading species at large scales, the mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance to diverse communities at local scales remain unknown. Using neighbourhood analyses, a technique from plant competition studies(17-19), we show here that species diversity in small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance by increasing crowding and species richness in localized plant neighbourhoods.

Understanding these dynamics is especially important for habitats subject to reestablishment of historical disturbance regimes; because many invasive species respond positively to disturbance, interactions between colonizing natives and nonnatives at the seedling stage may determine success of invasions. In the American Southwest, reduced flood disturbance in this century has been associated with the invasion of nonnative Tamarix ramosissima, with Tamarix appearing to displace native flood-dependent species of Populus and Salix. We studied two riparian communities of these woody species that had established after over-bunk flooding was allowed to occur in two protected areas in New Mexico. Growth and mortality were monitored for each individual within 1-m(2) plots of seedling communities within these sites for 2-4 yr. Abiotic conditions measured for each plot included soil salinity, texture, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. Although Tamarix seedling densities were an order of magnitude greater than those of the native species at initial establishment, mortality of Tamarix was also much greater than for Populus or Salix and occurred primarily in plot where native species were the most dense. Both natives were taller and grew faster above ground than Tamarix in the first 4 yr, and growth of Tamarix was negatively correlated with neighbor densities. In contrast, Populus and Salix growth and survival were never correlated with Tamarix densities. For all species, none of the abiotic variables measured was as important as neighbor density for explaining growth and survival patterns. These results have positive implications for managers who wish to reestablish the native dominants of riparian forests through reinstatement of flooding. Although Tamarix can respond positively to flooding, a range of conditions clearly exists in which Populus and Salix establishment can be stimulated by flooding, even when Tamarix seedlings are present. Furthermore, the presence of such natives even at the seedling stage may help to reduce densities of invasive Tamarix seedlings.",Web of Science,Tamarix ramosissima,United States,New  Mexico,Middle Rio Grande,33.48,-106.53,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

We tested this hypothesis for the invasive forb Rorippa austriaca (Brassicaceae). Regeneration from root fragments, subsequent vegetative spread and allocation patterns in relation to varied nutrient supply and intensity and pattern of interspecific competition were analyzed in container experiments. Regeneration success from root fragments was 100% and clonal spread was rapid but vegetative performance was strongly reduced under unfertilized conditions and, particularly, when interspecific competition was present. While the ratio of above- to belowground bio-mass did not differ considerably between treatments, R. austriaca allocated a high amount of resources to belowground growth resulting in low aboveground but high belowground biomass at harvest time relative to the matrix vegetation. Differences in shoot number or biomass between simulated gaps and densely vegetated quadrants in the containers were (relatively) weak. Reproductive effort was less reduced under low resource levels, and the clones did not set seed at all, irrespective of the treatment. Our results show that clonal growth by lateral roots and plasticity in clonal growth patterns in R. austriaca promote both exploitation of gaps and nutrient-rich microsites and resistance to competitors.

Here we use data on non-mariculture species from the north-eastern Pacific coast and from a global species pool to test the original hypothesis of Roy et al. that range limits of larger bivalves are more fluid than those of smaller species. First, we test the hypothesis that larger bivalve species are more successful than small species in expanding their geographical ranges following introduction into new regions. Second, we compare body sizes of indigenous and non-indigenous species for 299 of the 303 known intertidal and shelf species within the marine bivalve clade that contains the greater number of non-mariculture invaders, the Mytilidae.

The relative cover of exotic species decreased with time since abandonment, with significant declines occurring greater than or equal to 20 yr post-abandonment. The number of exotic species per plot also declined with time since abandonment while field-scale richness of exotics did not change. This suggests displacement occurring at small spatial scales. Life history types changed from short-lived herbaceous species to long-lived woody species for both native and exotic plant species. However, shrubs and lianas dominated woody cover of exotic plants while trees dominated native woody cover. The species richness of exotic and native species was positively correlated at most times. In abandoned hay fields, however, the proportion of exotic plant cover per plot was inversely related to total species richness. This relationship suggests that it is not the presence, but the abundance of exotic species that may cause a reduction in community diversity.

At the end of the 21-month study, the biomass of the volunteer native and alien species (i.e. unplanted species consisting mainly of relatively fast-growing shrubs) was nearly three and 13 times that of the seeded species, respectively. The biomass of the native volunteers was greater in the inter-canopy plots, greater for the seeded species in the sub-canopy plots, and did not differ significantly within this treatment for the alien species.

Lists of vascular plant species were obtained for each reserve, alien species were divided into archaeophytes and neophytes (introduced before and after 1500, respectively). The statistical analysis using general linear models made it possible to identify the effects of particular variables. Flora representation by neophytes decreased with altitude (explained 23.8% of variance) while, with archaeophytes, the effect of altitude depended on their interaction with native species in particular vegetation types. The proportion of neophytes increased with increasing density of human population. Both the number and proportion of aliens plants significantly increased with increasing number of native species in a reserve. This relationship was affected by altitude, and after filtering out this variable, the effect remained positive for neophytes but became negative for archaeophytes in humid grasslands. The positive relationship between neophytes and native species is not a mere side effect of species-area relationship of native flora, but indicates that the two groups do not directly compete. Vegetation type alone explained 14.2 and 55.5% of variation in proportion of aliens in regions of mesophilous and mountain flora, respectively.

Nutrient enrichment may adversely impact plant species richness in wetlands and enhance their susceptibility to colonization and dominance by invasive species. For North American prairie wetlands. enrichment by nitrate-N (NO3-N) from agricultural runoff is thought to contribute to the increasing colonization and dominance of Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass), especially during restoration. If true, P arundinacea might compromise the re-establishment of sedge meadow vegetation on sites reflooded with agricultural drainage water. 2. We tested this hypothesis using a fertilization experiment in wetlands with controlled hydrology. A community mixture comprising 11 species from native sedge meadow was seeded in mesocosms and grown under one of three NO3-N levels (0 g m(-2) year(-1), 12 g m(-2) year(-1), 48 g m(-2) year(-1)) with or without P arundinacea. Above- and below-ground biomass were measured after two growing seasons to assess the response of vegetation to NO3-N and P arundinacea treatments. 3. The total shoot biomass of the native community was suppressed in the presence of P arundinacea at all NO3-N levels, but shoot suppression was significantly greater at the highest NO3-N dose level (48 g m(-2)). Shoot growth of the native community was reduced by nearly one-half under these conditions. 4. The total root biomass of the community was also suppressed by P arundinacea when no NO3-N was added. 5. As NO3-N increased. the relative abundance (shoot biomass) of native graminoids declined while native forbs increased in communities with and without Phalaris. The most common graminoid. Glyceria grandis, was suppressed by P arundinacea at all levels, with suppression enhanced at the 48 g m(-2) NO3-N level.

The two most common forbs, Asclepias incarnata and Sium suave. exhibited a continual increase in growth with NO3-N additions along with overall suppression by P. arundinacea. 6. Community diversity and evenness declined with increasing NO3-N levels, whether or not P arundinacea was present. 7. Our results demonstrate that if P arundinacea is present. the restored sedge meadow community will not achieve levels of abundance that are possible when this species is absent. regardless of NO3-N enrichment conditions. 8. At the same time, the increased suppression by P arundinacea at the 48 g m(-2) NO3-N dose level supports the hypothesis that the dominance of this species over the native sedge meadow community is enhanced by NO3-N inputs at levels that are common in agricultural landscapes. 9. Our results carry two implications for achieving biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. First. reducing nitrate loads to wetland reserves is essential for minimizing declines in community diversity. Secondly, the use of P arundinacea for soil conservation and other agri-environmental purposes should be curtailed because of the likelihood of off-site impacts to wetland biodiversity.",Web of Science,Phalaris arundinacea (reed canary grass),United States,Minnesota,Minnesota Horticultural Research Center,44.51,-93.36,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Wetland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

In general, mounds were characterised by a degraded soil surface dominated by bare soil and coarse gravel, whilst adjacent non-mound (control) surfaces were characterised by an extensive cover of cryptogams (lichens and mosses). Mounds supported significantly more exotic plants than non-mounds, and there was a clear separation between the two microsites in terms of the cover-abundances of vascular plants. Mound microsites contained significantly more tall (> 50 cm) species, and species with burrs compared with non-mound microsites.

However, in this study we show that a mapped population of B. australe experienced a marked decrease in survival and reproduction after an accidental fire in May 1995. Mortality was not due to the direct effects of fire; in the year following the fire, survival was normal and reproduction was higher than in previous years. however, after 1996 an introduced grass (Agrostis capillaris) spread across the area and B. australe survival in the second to fourth years after the fire (1996 1999, 59.63%) was significantly lower than survival before the fire, and plants did not produce spores at all during this 3-yr period.

I examined their importance in controlling the number of native and exotic plant species occupying tussocks formed by the sedge Carex nudata along a California stream. Of particular interest were the factors underlying a downstream increase in plant diversity and biological invasions. I conducted seed addition experiments and manipulated local diversity and cover to evaluate the degree to which tussocks saturate with species, and to examine the roles of local competitive processes, abiotic factors, and seed supply in controlling the system-wide patterns. Seeds of three native and three exotic plants sown onto experimentally assembled tussock communities less successfully established on tussocks with a greater richness of resident plants. Nonetheless, even the most diverse tussocks were somewhat colonized, suggesting that tussocks are not completely saturated with species. Similarly, in an experiment where I sowed seeds onto natural tussocks along the river, colonization increased two- to three-fold when I removed the resident species. Even on intact tussocks, however, seed addition increased diversity, indicating that the tussock assemblages are seed limited. Colonization success on cleared and uncleared tussocks increased downstream from km 0 to km 3 of the study site, but showed no trends from km 3 to km 8. This suggests that while abiotic and biotic features of the tussocks may control the increase in diversity and invasions from km 0 to km 3, similar increases from km 3 to km 8 are more likely explained by potential downstream increases in seed supply. The effective water dispersal of seed mimics and prevailingly downstream winds indicated that dispersal most likely occurs in a downstream direction.

To compare the dynamics of invasion in highly invaded nonserpentine oak woodlands and less-invaded serpentine habitats, we used an historical *experiment* consisting of the introduction of several normative species for post-mining revegetation, supplemented by a pot experiment and a factorial field experiment. Three species showed significant declines in abundance on transects from revegetated zones into natural habitats, indicating that these species had spread into the natural habitats from revegetated zones. Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium hirtum were found up to 95 m into oak woodland, 35 m into serpentine meadows, and 0-25 m into serpentine seeps and chaparral, while Elytrigia pontica was found up to 45 m into serpentine seeps. The pot experiment showed that this pattern of distribution for Dactylis was not caused or limited by variation in soil properties. The field experiment showed that Dactylis invasion in both oak woodland and serpentine meadow habitats was limited by disturbance and seed supply. Dactylis success was negatively correlated with species richness in oak woodlands, but positively correlated with richness in serpentine meadows, suggesting that the relationships between diversity, invasion, and underlying habitat suitability differed between these habitats.

Despite this, there have been few experimental studies that directly examine these interactions. Two morphologically similar perennial grass species in the genus Cortaderia are currently invasive pest's in California, but their patterns of invasion differ. In this study I experimentally compared the performance of the two species across four vegetation types in central California. I examined how the different invasive patterns of the species result from differential responses to environmental factors that vary over relatively small spatial and temporal scales. Cortaderia selloana had consistently higher seed germination than C. jubata, but germination rates interacted significantly with soil disturbance and habitat type, and these interactions varied between experimental years. When mammalian herbivores were excluded, the principal cause of transplant mortality was physiological stress, and C. selloana transplants had greater survivorship than C. jubata transplants in all habitats except maritime chaparral. In the presence of mammalian herbivores, however, herbivory became the dominant source of transplant mortality, and the survivorship of both species was indistinguishable in all habitats. At the seasonal wetland site, patterns of transplant survivorship varied significantly between years, probably as a result of increased competition for water during the second experimental year. Transplants of the two species did not differ significantly in growth except at the seasonal wetland site where C. selloana transplants added significantly more leaf area than C. jubata transplants. These results indicate that the relative invasive potential of C. selloana and C. jubata is strongly moderated by the presence of generalist herbivores. The influence of herbivory is in turn dependent on the community type. In addition, plant competitors can modify the invasive success of the two species, but the effect of competitors varies with seasonal differences in resource supply. Although important mechanisms that influence the invasion process can be identified, the complex invasion dynamics exhibited by these morphologically similar species across relatively small spatial and temporal scales suggest that overly broad invasion rules will be of little practical utility in the regional management of invasive species.",Web of Science,Cortaderia selloana and Cortaderia jubata,United States,California,"Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), Santa Barbara County",34.73,-120.53,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland;Chaparral/Shrublands,Fundamentals;Invasion Hyp.,Fluctuating Resources;Disturbance,,primary

A similar analysis of the habitat requisites for the associated natural enemies of the plant/phytophage should enable the development of predictive models that identify habitat factors conducive to the establishment and impact on the particular plant or phytophage species. In this study, habitat associations were characterized for four different Euphorbia species and their associated flea beetle species in the Aphthona complex from 17 field sites in Europe, representing xeric, mesic, and hydric habitats. Micro- and macronutrient analyses were conducted on soil and spurge foliage and roots; physical properties of the soil were analyzed; plant cover of grasses, forbs (a broad-leaved herbaceous plant), and Euphorbia species (and total plant productivity) were estimated at each of the sites, and relative abundance counts were made for each of the flea beetle species at each of the 17 sites during spring, early summer, and mid-summer 1991.

Flea beetles species included Aphthona cyparissiae, A. czwalinae, A. lacertosa, A. nigriscutis, A. pygmaea, A. venustula, and A. violacea.

In contrast, E. cyparissias and E. seguieriana were associated with relatively lower levels of plant productivity and higher levels of sand, CaCO3, and Zn (soil layer A). Ordination models developed for the Aphthona species suggested that A czwalinae and A lacertosa were associated with sites containing higher levels of clay and plant productivity and higher levels of Mn in the Euphorbia roots; A. violacea was associated with sites with intermediate levels of sand, clay, and plant productivity, in addition to spurge roots with higher levels of Cu, Fe, K, N, P, and Zn.

The inhibitory effect of standing dead vegetation on seedling emergence diminished by the third year as this dead biomass decomposed.

Seedling emergence was relatively high near trees in bogs but was not increased by removing shrubs. Tall shrubs and trees were the preferred perches of avian dispersers and probably shaded the disturbed plots in these areas. Hence, the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on seedling emergence of this invasive shrub can be overridden by increased seed deposition and shade from adjacent trees and tall shrubs.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plant diversity, herbivory and performance of two annual exotics, Conyza bonariensis and C. canadensis, in Mediterranean annual communities. We wanted to test whether herbivory of these exotics was influenced either by species richness, functional-group richness or functional-group composition. We also studied the relationship between herbivory on the exotic species and their performance. Herbivory increased with increasing species and functional-group richness for both Conyza species. These patterns are interpreted as reflecting a greater number of available herbivore niches in a richer, more complex, plant community. The identities of functional groups also affected Conyza herbivory, which decreased in the presence of Asteraceae or Fabaceae and increased in the presence of Poaceae. Increasing herbivory had consequences for vegetative and demographic parameters of both invasive species: survival, final biomass and net fecundity decreased with increasing herbivory, leading to a loss of reproductive capacity.

While tetraploidy makes it impossible to analyze variation in R. alceifolius using classical methods of population genetics, both the patterns of genetic diversity (as revealed by AFLP [amplified fragment length polymorphism] markers) and differences between half-sib progeny and their maternal parents (revealed by microsatellite markers) show that in the plant's native range in southeast Asia. seeds are produced sexually, In contrast, in Madagascar sexual reproduction cannot alone account for the genetic patterns observed with microsatellite markers.

Honey bees were the most common visitors at each of three transects established at three study locales in California: University of California at Davis, Cosumnes River Preserve. and Santa Cruz Island. A significant correlation existed between honey bee visitation levels monitored in all these transects and the average number of viable seeds per seed head for the same transects. Selective exclusion of honey bees at flower heads using a 3 mm diameter mesh significantly reduced seed set per seed head at all locales. Seed set depression was less dramatic at the island locale because of high visitation rates by generalist halictid bees Augochlorella pomoniella and Agapostemon texanus that penetrated the 3-mm mesh.

In a field experiment, in which we manipulated resources and competition, we confirmed that changes in resource availability affected competition intensity, which in turn affected invasibility. We found that fluctuations in resource availability of as short as a few weeks had a large impact on plant invasion success (survival and percentage cover), including up to 1 year following the fluctuations. If resource availability is a primary mechanism controlling invasibility, it may serve as a unifying concept that can integrate earlier ideas regarding invasibility. The results emphasize the important role of history in the invasion process, particularly the occurrence of stochastic, short-lived events that temporarily reduce or suspend competition and increase invasibility.

It has also been suggested that such biotic resistance has a negligible influence on the outcome of an invasion, but that the abiotic characteristics of the environment being invaded are more important. The latter has been claimed to be especially important on the islands of the Southern Ocean. In order to test these competing hypotheses we examined the distribution and abundance of indigenous and introduced springtails across 13 habitats, which differ considerably in the properties of their soils, and soil temperature, on the eastern quarter of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. There was no evidence of negative abundance covariation or species associations within habitats, nor were there significant relationships between species richness or abundance of the indigenous as opposed to the introduced collembolans across habitats. Interspecific interactions thus seem to have played no readily identifiable role in the outcome of invasions by Collembola on Marion Island. In contrast, the indigenous and introduced species responded very differently to abiotic variables. The indigenous Collembola prefer drier, more mineral soils with a low organic carbon content, and species richness tends to be highest in cold, fellfield areas. On the other hand, the introduced springtails prefer moist, warm sites, with organically enriched soils. Introduced species richness was negligible in cold, fellfield areas. Disturbance also appeared to influence positively the species richness and abundance of introduced species at a site. These results provide independent support for the idea that abiotic factors, especially temperature, significantly influence the likelihood of biological invasions on Southern Ocean islands. They also suggest that predicting the outcome of climate change on community structure in this region is likely to be problematic, especially in the case of the Collembola.",Web of Science,Many,,Prince Edward Islands,Marion Island,-46.92,37.82,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland;Tundra,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness;Preadaptation to Climate;Disturbance,,primary

It has previously been hypothesized that low rates of attack by natural enemies may contribute to the invasiveness of exotic plants. 2. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the influence of pathogens on survival during a critical life-history stage: the seed bank. We used fungicide treatments to estimate the impacts of soil fungi on buried seeds of a taxonomically broad suite of congeneric natives and exotics, in both upland and wetland meadows. 3. Seeds of both natives and exotics were recovered at lower rates in wetlands than in uplands. Fungicide addition reduced this difference by improving recovery in wetlands, indicating that the lower recovery was largely attributable to a higher level of fungal mortality. This suggests that fungal pathogens may contribute to the exclusion of upland species from wetlands. 4. The effects of fungicide on the recovery of buried seeds did not differ between natives and exotics. Seeds of exotics were recovered at a higher rate than seeds of natives in uplands, but this effect was not attributable to fungal pathogens. 5. Fungal seed pathogens may offer poor prospects for the management of most exotic species.

It affects both hydrogeomorphic features and habitat characteristics and potentially impacts riverine flora and fauna. Human-disturbed fluvial ecosystems also appear to be particularly vulnerable to exotic plant establishment. Following a 12-year recovery period, the distribution, composition and cover of both exotic and native plant species were studied along a Portuguese lowland river segment, which had been subjected to resectioning, straightening and two-stage bank reinforcement, and were compared with those of a nearby, less impacted segment. The species distribution was also related to environmental data. Species richness and floristic composition in the channelized river segment were found to be similar to those at the more 'natural' river sites. Floral differences were primarily consistent with the dominance of cover by certain species. However, there were significant differences in exotic and native species richness and cover between the 'natural' corridor and the channelized segment, which was more susceptible to invasion by exotic perennial taxa, such as Eryngium pandanifolium, Paspalum paspalodes, Tradescantia fluminensis and Acacia dealbata. Factorial and canonical correspondence analyses revealed considerable patchiness in the distribution of species assemblages. The latter were associated with small differences in substrate composition and their own relative position across the banks and along the river segments in question.

In order to better characterize habitat vulnerability to invasion by A. petiolata, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of environmental heterogeneity in the form of habitat, microenvironment, and small-scale litter disturbance on A. petiolata germination, survival, growth, and reproduction. Treatments consisted of two habitats (upland and lowland), two microenvironments (forest edge and forest interior), and three small-scale litter disturbance treatments (control, litter completely removed, and litter partially removed). Seeds were sown into plots in November, and plots were monitored for two years. Lowland plots had greater soil moisture and less litter per unit area than upland plots. In general, forest edge plots had greater understory cover and light availability and lower overstory cover than forest interior plots. Rosette survival, mature plant survival, plant biomass, height, and fruit and seed production were significantly greater for plants in the lowland compared with plants in the upland. Germination, rosette survival, mature plant survival, and reproduction were significantly greater in the forest edge plots when compared with interior plots. Litter disturbance had no significant effect on germination, growth, or reproduction. It is apparent that site colonization by A. petiolata was not dependent on the creation of patches of bare soil by disturbance, since plants were capable of invading sites with an intact litter layer. Alliaria petiolata growth and reproduction was greatest in plots with adequate soil moisture and increased light availability. Therefore, mesic forests with a more open canopy structure and forest trails or edges may be the most vulnerable to invasion and the most difficult sites to manage.

In New Zealand. overgrazing of tussock grasslands in the South Island has led to land degradation and simultaneous invasion of exotic weeds (primarily Hieracium spp.) over large areas. While Hieracium continues to spread rapidly, little is known about variation in the impact of Hieracium across landscapes characterized by a range of environmental conditions. We examined the impact of Hieracium invasion on soil and ecosystem processes first at the scale of individual patches under one disturbance regime and uniform *environment* (i.e.. one aspect and elevation), and then under different environmental conditions (aspects) and disturbance regimes (long-term grazing, no grazing since 1978). Around individual plants on heavily grazed north-facing slopes with significant bare ground, Hieracium invasion increased total soil C and N and lowered soil pH and mineral N relative to the adjacent herb-field vegetation. Soil C mineralization was higher, and net N mineralization was lower under Hieracium than under the adjacent herb-field vegetation. Litter quality differences did not explain differences in net N mineralization. However, results from C-13 NMR spectroscopy suggest qualitative differences in organic-matter inputs under Hieracium compared to native vegetation. These results suggest that Hieracium may lower N availability by outcompeting native plants for mineral N, making it difficult for native species to reestablish and promoting the spread of Hieracium. Our results differed on cooler, wetter, less heavily grazed south-facing slopes, where soil C and N pools and cycling rates were lower under Hieracium than under the native herb-field vegetation (which differed across aspects). Whether the (longer term) impact of Hieracium on the south aspect resembles that on the north aspect may depend on management.

Berberis thunbergii, a woody shrub. forms dense thickets, while Microstegium vimineum, a C-4 grass, forms continuous lawns; the two species often co-occur. We hypothesized that a variety of characteristics of the exotic species may cause soil-based ecosystem processes to change following invasion, and that such changes could establish positive feedback processes that enhance the spread of the exotic. We examined changes in soil pH, nitrogen cycling, and litter dynamics in stands infested with both species in three locations in northern New Jersey (USA). Soils directly beneath each of the two exotics had higher pH values and higher nitrification rates and often had higher net N mineralization rates than did soils beneath adjacent patches of the most common native understory shrub, Vaccinium pallidum. These differences could be replicated in the greenhouse by growing the exotics in previously uninvaded soils. Berberis litter was much higher in N concentration than was litter of the native species; it decomposed more rapidly than litter of native dominant tree species, with little or no immobilization of N. In contrast, Microstegium litter decomposed more slowly than the native species' litters, and it immobilized N. We suggest that the same change in soil-increased pH and nitrification-result from different combinations of mechanisms in the two exotic species. Both species evidently favor uptake of nitrate. which may elevate pH. However, Berberis combines large biomasses of N-rich roots with N-rich leaf litter, while Microstegium populations combines small biomasses of N-rich roots with small biomasses of N-poor litter that leave much of the surface soil with few roots.

Avenues and roadsides have been planted with eastern Australian species, including Eucalyptus cladocalyx (sugar gum) and Eucalyptus botryoides (southern mahogany), both of which have become invasive. The present study examined the effect of a recent burn on the level of herbivory on these native and exotic eucalypts. Leaf damage, shoot extension and number of new leaves were measured on tagged shoots of saplings of each tree species in unburnt and burnt areas over an 8-month period. Leaf macronutrient levels were quantified and the number of arthropods on saplings was measured at the end of the recording period by chemical knockdown. Leaf macronutrients were mostly higher in all four species in the burnt area, and this was associated with generally higher numbers of canopy arthropods and greater levels of leaf damage. It is suggested that the pulse of soil nutrients after the fire resulted in more nutrient-rich foliage, which in turn was more palatable to arthropods. The resulting high levels of herbivory possibly led to reduced shoot extension of E. gomphocephala, E. botryoides and, to a lesser extent, E. cladocalyx. This acts as a negative feedback mechanism that lessens the tendency for lush, post-fire regrowth to outcompete other species of plants. There was no consistent difference in the levels of the various types of leaf damage or of arthropods on the native and the exotic eucalypts, suggesting that freedom from herbivory is not contributing to the invasiveness of the two exotic species.",Web of Science,Eucalyptus cladocalyx; Eucalyptus botryoides,Australia,Western Australia,Kings Park,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

We found that continuous, nonlinear patches of spotted knapweed on loamy soil that were surrounded by even-age forest stands had the highest rates of establishment for A. zoegana, but likelihood of establishment was not greater for larger releases (>200 adults). This suggests that roadside strips of knapweed should not be selected as release sites and that many, smaller releases (100-200 adults) are better than fewer, larger releases (300-500 adults or greater). For the weevil C. achates, we found that the probability of establishment was also greatest in continuous knapweed patches, rather than in strips, and that larger infestations (>2 ha) were better than smaller infestations.

In this study, I conducted a common garden transplant experiment using replicate clones of an introduced tunicate, Botrylloides sp., collected from three sites in the southern Gulf of Maine to test for differential growth and survival in response to local thermal regimes. This species has a restricted larval development period, which may permit significant population differentiation over relatively small spatial scales. I found dramatic among-site differences in survival rates: tunicates collected from both the transplant site and from a distant northern site had high survival, while those collected from a southern site experienced 100% mortality. The most likely cause of this differential mortality was an anomalous upwelling event that produced some of the coldest mid-summer temperatures in the last 10 years based on NOAA weather buoy data. I also found significant differences in growth rates among sites as well as among clones within a site in comparison with growth-rate differences within clones. An estimate of broad-sense heritability based on these data was consistent with a genetic basis for among-site differences in growth rates, which were strongly predictive of subsequent mortality.

Seedlings can be injured or killed by floods that deposit sediment, but as seedlings grow larger they develop greater resistance to damage from flood flows. On dam-regulate streams, natural sedimentation processes are interrupted, possibly altering competitive dynamics among seedlings. In this suite of experiments, seeds of three native woody species, Baccharis salicifolia, Populus fremontii, Salix gooddingii, and an exotic, Tamarix ramosissima, were sawn in greenhouse pots. Seedlings were experimentally buried by sediment at progressive age intervals up to ninety days. Sediment treatments varied in terms of depth (1 and 2 cm) and method of application (undisturbed sifting or forceful burial). Our studies indicated that at an early age, P. fremontii had significantly greater ability than T ramosissima, S. gooddingii and B. salicifolia to survive 1 cm sifted sediment deposition. However, as the seedlings became taller, survivorship of S. gooddingii and T. ramosissima approached or equalled that of P. fremontii. Tamarix ramosissima had greater survivorship than native species only when it also was taller; in some cases, natives had greater survivorship when they were shorter than T. ramosissima. Populus fremontii survived I cm of sediment deposition in large numbers by the time it reached 2 cm tall; a size that it reached at a very young age (< 2 weeks). Salix gooddingii showed high survivorship at 3-4 cm, but required five weeks to achieve this threshold height. Tamarix ramosissima survived in large numbers when it reached a height range of 4-6 cm, a value it did not attain until it also was nearly 5 weeks of age. These results suggest that P. fremontii may be more competitive than T. ramosissima under natural sediment flow regimes. One approach to managing for native species involves restoring the physical conditions under which they are more competitive. Based on the results of our experiments and those of others, we suggest ways in which discharges of water and sediment in degraded reaches could be managed to favor the establishment of desired native species.

Competitive ability was divided into the competitive effect, or the ability to deplete resources, and the competitive response, or the ability to tolerate low resource levels. The plants were grown in pots with or without Hieracium, in shade or full sunlight, and with high or low soil fertility. The competitive response rankings showed consistent hierarchies in the different treatments with Festuca being less suppressed than Acaena and Raoulia. Festuca performed especially well in low soil fertility and in shaded treatments, while the other two species were strongly suppressed by Hieracium even in those conditions. However, all three species did relatively better (less badly) in the low fertility and shaded treatments than in the more resource-rich treatments when interacting with Hieracium. The effect on Hieracium biomass of the indigenous species was generally small and the rankings of competitive effect showed no agreement between the species in the different environmental treatments. We suggest that competitive rankings based on the competitive response component is likely to be a more sensitive measure of competitive ability for these indigenous, slow-growing plants.

A detailed basic study at a single ruderal site and a parallel investigation at each five ruderal and five agricultural sites were conducted from April to November 1997. During the whole period of study the spatial distribution of plants was aggregated and plants showed a relatively large size hierarchy as indicated by mean values of the Gini coefficient higher than 0.5. Seedling establishment appeared to be a major factor influencing the dynamics of S. Vulgaris. The importance of seedling establishment, together with the observed short generation time of 5 weeks and the broad range of plant sizes at reproduction classifies S. vulgaris as a ruderal strategist. The population dynamics of S. vulgaris differed between the ruderal and the agricultural habitat. Plants of S. vulgaris at the ruderal habitat survived over winter, resulting in greater population sizes (0.1 to 1 of the maximum) and a majority of plants in flower and seed set (31.9%) in spring. At the agricultural habitat, where only a few S. vulgaris winter due to weed control measures, population sizes in spring were smaller (0 to 0.16 of the maximum) with mainly vegetative plants (66.7%). The limited number of suitable hosts at the agricultural habitat in spring lead to a delay of rust infection until August, in contrast to the ruderal habitat where the rust was already present in April.

The sites were in large continuous areas of native eucalypt forest, an extensive plantation of P. radiata, and sites in patches of remnant eucalypt forest embedded within the pine plantation. In the case of the 507 plots located within patches of remnant eucalypt forest, an array of variables (e.g. distance to surrounding pine plantation, and floristic and structural attributes) was measured and used in statistical analyses of non-native plant occurrence. P. radiata wildlings were totally absent from plots in large continuous areas of native eucalypt forest, but present at 5% of plots within patches of eucalypt remnants embedded within the pine plantation. Logistic regression showed that the occurrence of P. radiata wildlings in the eucalypt remnants was significantly higher in plots where the neighbouring pine plantation had been established for a long time, plots that were dominated by dry eucalypt forest types, and plots with a limited cover of ground vegetation. The occurrence of R. fruticosus differed significantly (P<0.001) between the groups of sites; 59% of plots in the pine plantation, 41% in the eucalypt remnants, and 7% in continuous areas of native forest were invaded. For the eucalypt remnants, the occurrence of this species was significantly greater in plots close to the surrounding pine plantation, with fewer species of native shrubs, in wet eucalypt forest types, and with low values for both eucalypt basal area and rock cover. The results of this study indicate that even though non-native plant invasion is already relatively extensive in the study area, it is likely to further increase. The array of factors influencing the spread and establishment of P. radiata wildlings and R. fruticosus indicate that the control of these non-native plants will be extremely difficult in the existing plantation estate.

We tested whether disturbances facilitated tree seedling recruitment and survival once seeds of invaders were made available by hand sowing. Seed addition to grassland failed to produce seedlings of two study species, Ligustrum lucidum and Ulmus pumila, but did result in abundant recruitment of Gleditsia triacanthos and Prosopis caldenia. While emergence was sparse in intact grassland, seedling densities were significantly increased by canopy and soil disturbances. Longer-term surveys showed that only Gleditsia became successfully established in disturbed grassland. These results support the hypothesis that interference from herbaceous vegetation may play a significant role in slowing down tree invasion, whereas disturbances create microsites that can be exploited by invasive woody plants. Seed sowing in a Ligustrum forest promoted the emergence of all four study species in understorey and treefall gap conditions. Litter removal had species-specific effects on emergence and early seedling growth, but had little impact on survivorship. Seedlings emerging under the closed forest canopy died within a few months. In the treefall gap, recruits of Gleditsia and Prosopis survived the first year, but did not survive in the longer term after natural gap closure. The forest community thus appeared less susceptible to colonization by alien trees than the grassland. We conclude that tree invasion in this system is strongly limited by the availability of recruitment microsites and biotic interactions, as well as by dispersal from existing propagule sources.",Web of Science,Gleditsia triacanthos L.; Ulmus pumila L.; Ligustrum lucidum Ait.; Prosopis caldenia Burk.,Argentina,Carlos Casares,Inland Pampas; Estancia San Claudio,-36,-61.0833,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Fundamentals;Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

We investigated factors hypothesized to influence introduction success and subsequent geographical range size in 52 species of bird that have been introduced to mainland Australia. 2. The 19 successful species had been introduced more times, at more sites and in greater overall numbers. Relative to failed species, successfully introduced species also had a greater area of climatically suitable habitat available in Australia, a larger overseas range size and were more likely to have been introduced successfully outside Australia. After controlling for phylogeny these relationships held, except that with overseas range size and, in addition, larger-bodied species had a higher probability of introduction success. There was also a marked taxonomic bias: gamebirds had a much lower probability of success than other species. A model including five of these variables explained perfectly the patterns in introduction success across-species. 3. Of the successful species, those with larger geographical ranges in Australia had a greater area of climatically suitable habitat, traits associated with a faster population growth rate (small body size, short incubation period and more broods per season) and a larger overseas range size.

During sequential stages of ballast transfer (uptake, transport, and release), the density and diversity of the plankton assemblage is selectively filtered, determining the pool of potential invaders. Understanding taxon-specific patterns of mortality along the invasion pathway is key to understanding and predicting successful invasions. We quantified taxon-specific trends in plankton mortality during a 16 d trans-Atlantic ballast water voyage. In the ballast tanks, we collected a miminum of 50 live taxa. Over 50 % of taxa and > 98% of organisms collected in initial samples were not detected at the end of the voyage. No ballasted organisms survived experimental transfer to coastal harbor water. We suggest that the invasion success of a particular taxon may be predicted both by high density at the end of a voyage (which is comparatively easy to measure) and by low mortality during a voyage (which may indicate good body condition, but is harder to measure). These 2 predictors were not, however, correlated across taxa. Mid-ocean exchange, the most widely used method for reducing ballast-mediated invasion risk, alters the pool of potential invaders. In an experimental test of mid-ocean exchange, 93 to 100 % of the coastal water and 80 to 100 % of the coastal organisms were removed.

In south Florida, this plant has invaded abandoned agricultural lands, poorly managed pastures, roadsides, and canal banks extensively. The *Hole-in-the Donut (HID)*, approximately 4000 ha within the Everglades National Park, is a major site of invasion of this exotic plant. This area was previously short hydroperiod prairie and pineland, but it is now a monospecific stand of Brazilian pepper. It has been hypothesized that this transformation is related to rock-plowing soil (crushing the limestone bedrock to increase soil depth) and to intensive vegetable production 25 to 70 years ago. The objectives of this study were to compare the chemical and physical differences of soils from four land uses (undisturbed land, rock-plowed farm land, non-rock-plowed farm land, and restored land) and the mineral nutrient contents of Brazilian pepper and sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz). Farming in the HID area changed the soil chemical properties significantly through rock-plowing and the application of agrichemicals necessary for commercial vegetable production. Rock-plowing increased the percenage of rock fragments and the soil pH. Total concentrations of nutrients (N, P, Zn, and Cu) in soils were elevated in both rock-plowed and non-rock-plowed farm lands. Plant-available nutrients in soil of rock-plowed farm land increased about 3 times for P, 6 times for Zn, and 10 times for Cu. As a result of the increased soil fertility, concentrations of P and Zn in Brazilian pepper leaves were 5 and 3 times higher, respectively, than those in sawgrass.

In greenhouse experiments, buried seeds had higher germination rates and percentages than surface seeds, and simulated and actual seed passage through the avian gut enhanced germination. One year of aging reduced germination and seed viability, particularly for seeds unhandled by birds. In the field, seedling emergence and survival were greater in mixed pine-hardwood forest than in pine-turkey oak forest or spoil areas. Planting date did not affect overall seedling emergence or survival. Seeds sown in March 1998 and 1999 in five coastal forests that contained established tallow trees emerged throughout the growing season. While seedling emergence rates varied, final seedling numbers were similar across habitats in 1998, but were lower and differed across habitats in 1999. Recruitment was thus spatially and temporally variable. Viability of seeds buried for one and two years ranged from 16 to 69% in the five habitats, but did not differ among habitats or length of burial time. Because habitat type did not affect seed dormancy (both years) and final seedling number (1998 only), we conclude that other factors influence the differential success of tallow trees among coastal forests in South Carolina.

However, alien species are significantly more prevalent on small patches of serpentine (< 5 ha) than in the interiors (> 100 m from edges) of very large ones (< 1 km(2)). We studied reasons for this pattern, focusing on the Mediterranean annual grasses Avena fatua L. and Bromus hordeaceus L. Using field transects, we found that both Avena and Bromus were more common at the edges of large patches than in large-patch interiors, even though soils from edges were not significantly different from soils in interiors. Using a growth experiment, we found that soils from small patches did not support better growth of either grass than soils from large-patch interiors. We conclude that the observed pattern is probably caused by small patches and large-patch edges receiving a higher flow of propagules from the nonserpentine matrix, and not by differences in habitat suitability. In both species, populations from small serpentine patches outperformed nonserpentine populations when grown on small-patch soil. This suggests that small serpentine patches may promote the evolution of serpentine-tolerant ecotypes of these alien grasses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We describe here a 1999 study in which we quantified stand characteristics of L. salicaria and associated vegetation in arrays of 30 1-m(2) plots in each of five wet meadows in Connecticut, USA. We explored linear and non-linear relationships of above-ground plant biomass. stem density, and indices of species richness, diversity, and composition to gradients of L. salicaria dominance, including stem density, percent cover, and biomass. Species richness, other diversity metrics, and stem density of other species were not significantly correlated with the density or percent cover of L. salicaria stems. The relative importance values (number of quadrats in which they were found) of co-occurring species in low-density L. salicaria quadrats were significantly correlated with their relative importance in high-density L. salicaria quadrats, indicating that only modest shifts in abundance occurred as L. salicaria increased in density. No individual species were consistently associated with or repelled by the presence of L. salicaria across sites. In contrast to density and diversity features, however, the total biomass of species other than L. salicaria was significantly, negatively correlated with the total biomass of L. salicaria at each site surveyed. Lythrum salicaria in pure, dense stands maintained a greater above-ground standing biomass on invaded sites than uninvaded vegetation of similar physiognomy. This study demonstrates that hypotheses about L. salicaria effects can vary depending upon the ecological metric that is examined.

When species were grouped as invasive (two species), noninvasive (five species), and native (six species), no differences were found for the suite of traits examined, likely because of the high variability within and between groups. However, when exotic species, regardless of invasiveness, were compared with the native species, specific leaf area was ca. 40% higher for the exotic species, a result that is consistent with that of other studies. This pattern was also observed for five of seven pairwise comparisons of exotic and native species with similar life history traits. In contrast, total end-of-season biomass was as much as three times higher for the native species in five of seven of the native-exotic species pairs. For other traits, differences between exotic and native species were species-specific and were generally more numerous for noninvasive than for invasive exotic species pair-wise comparisons. Thus, contrary to predictions, exotic species capable of successfully invading tallgrass prairie did not differ considerably from native species in most traits related to resource utilization and carbon gain. Moreover, invasive exotic species, those capable of displacing native species and dominating a community, were not distinct for the observed traits from their native counterparts.

In a series of field observations and greenhouse experiments, we compared the phenology, ovule production, seed production, and seed germination in H. contortus and P. setaceum. In the field, the alien produced two to nine times more seeds per plant than the native. Furthermore, the germination rate for fresh seeds was significantly greater for P. setaceum (45%) than for H. contortus (13%), giving the alien the ability to quickly spread after setting seed. In greenhouse experiments, clipping, burning, and pollen addition did not affect final reproductive output or seed-set rate in either species. However, P. setaceum recovered from clipping and burning more rapidly both in terms of vegetative regrowth and flowering, which likely gives it an advantage in disturbed environments and in competition with H. contortus. When plants were grown under varying nutrient and water conditions, P. setaceum failed to produce seeds in low-water and low-nutrient treatments.

ECOTONE simulates the recruitment, growth, and mortality of individual plants on a small plot (0.12 m(2)) through time at an annual time step. A daily time step, multi-layer model of soil water dynamics (SOILWAT) was incorporated into ECOTONE to represent competition for soil water on a finer temporal scale. The model was parameterized for a shortgrass community in eastern Colorado, USA, using data available from the literature. Experimental simulations examined the effects of four soil textures and a range of levels of plant sensitivity to allelochemicals on the aboveground biomass of A. repens and of native perennial grasses. Simulation results showed that A. repens dominated the aboveground biomass on a plot only if native species were affected by allelopathic interactions. At moderate levels of plant sensitivity, A. repens became dominant faster and reached a higher proportion of the total biomass on fine- than on coarse-textured soils. Community composition and rate of A. repens dominance were more affected by the sensitivity of plant growth to allelochemicals than the sensitivity of species recruitment.

The most dramatic observation was the protracted expansion in populations of Brachypodium pinnatum, despite being at the northern limit of its distribution in Britain. In contrast, all other sown species, including those of both southern and widespread distribution in Britain, had become extinct, declined or remained unchanged in abundance. 4. Patterns of establishment were strongly deterministic. Populations of the southern grass, B. pinnatum, were highest in areas of the experimental plots unamended by fertilizer and physical disturbance, but expansion was apparently promoted by cessation of management. Among invaders of widespread distribution, two were dependent upon fertilizer addition (Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis glomerata), one significantly increased its cover with a combination of fertilizer and disturbance (Holcus lanatus), and one benefited from disturbance (Plantago lanceolata). 5. Two southern perennials, Origanum vulgare and Senecio erucifolius, both remained present in 1999 in plots that were formerly heated and subject to drought (1991-96), whereas they had become extinct in control plots. 6. Although the most successful invader was a rhizomatous perennial grass, an alternative strategy for survival and expansion was revealed after the severe drought in 1995: gap recolonization by annuals with a persistent seed bank. 7. Most notably, this study revealed the hidden potential of a native species to establish beyond its current range of distribution and, contrary to many recognized weeds, the capacity to achieve dominance in the absence of eutrophication or disturbance.

Echium plantagineum is native to the western Mediterranean Basin, where it is a common, but not dominant, component of species-rich annual grasslands. Since its introduction into Australia, E. plantagineum has spread to infest vast areas of predominantly agricultural land in south-east and south-west Australia, where it can be the dominant pasture species. 2. To unravel the ecological factors responsible for the high population abundance of E. plantagineum in Australia, its demography was compared between sites in the invaded and native ranges. Demographic parameters of E. plantagineum populations were estimated at a site near Canberra in south-eastern Australia, and at a site near Evora in southern Portugal. Identical factorial experiments were set up at each site with treatment combinations of the presence or absence of grazing and pasture competition. 3. The recruitment, survival, fecundity and seed bank dynamics of E. plantagineum populations were measured for each of the treatment combinations over 2 years at each site. These data allowed the estimation of demographic parameters describing the proportion of E. plantagineum individuals moving from one life-cycle stage to the next. 4. Seedling establishment fractions were two to five times greater at Canberra than at Evora, and seed bank incorporation rates were three times greater at Canberra than Evora. These demographic differences were those most likely to play an important role in the greater abundance of E. plantagineum in Australia compared with Mediterranean Europe. Neither seed bank survival rates nor seed production differed between populations at Canberra and Evora, while seedling survival rates were always lower at Canberra than at Evora. 5. Neither grazing nor pasture competition limited the seed production or seedling survival of E. plantagineum populations at Evora more than at Canberra. 6. An effective approach for the control of E. plantagineum in Australia may thus be through the reduction of the seedling establishment fraction. This may be achieved by maintaining significant pasture vegetation cover and reducing the available space for E. plantagineum establishment during autumn.",Web of Science,Echium plantagineum,Australia,Canberra,Australian Capital Territory,-35.18,149.08,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Disturbance,Superior Competitor,primary

The role of environmental factors, natural and anthropogenic disturbance in relation to invasion history was assessed for different stages in the invasion process using a Geographic Information System. Pines escaped from plantations over the past 30 years and spread into the natural semi-arid shrubland (renosterveld). The pattern of spread was compared with a simulated random distribution using two different techniques, a standard logistic regression, and a new recursive modelling approach (Formal Inference-based Recursive Modelling; FIRM). FIRM analysis improved the accuracy of predictions and revealed interactive effects of variables hidden by the logistic regression analysis. More than 80% of isolated pine individuals were found in 20% of the habitat classified as suitable by the models. Soil pH was the most important predictor for the distribution of isolated trees, whereas the establishment of dense pine stands was largely determined by fire history. Differences in invasive behaviour could be explained by species attributes such as limited dispersal for P. canariensis, and better drought-tolerance for P. halepensis. Sixty-five percent of the current pine distribution was accurately predicted by the spatial distribution of the first trees to have invaded. Such models could be used to predict potential spread of invasive plants and gain a better understanding of the main factors driving the invasion process. However, the spread of invasive species in fragmented landscapes, strongly modified by human activities, is very complicated, and the spread remains difficult to predict in the long term.

We investigated the influence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus aggregatum Schenck and Smith emend. Koske, on the vegetative growth and sexual reproductive potential of L. salicaria. Mycorrhiza decreased plant biomass both aboveground and belowground. Flower production, number of days to anthesis, numbers of flowers per inflorescence, and inflorescence lengths were not significantly different between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal treatments. However, pollen production per anther and per flower increased with mycorrhizal colonization. Though ovule production was not affected, some aspects of purple loosestrife morphology did change. Plants with mycorrhizae produced inflorescence (in lateral positions) further up the stem. In addition, flower distribution within an inflorescence differed according to morph (short, mid, and long style) such that in the mid and long morphs flower number increased with inflorescence length and was unevenly distributed, while in the short morph this distribution appeared even. The relative biomass of stems, leaves, lateral branches, and reproductive structures were not significantly different in mycorrhizal plants, whereas in the absence of mycorrhizal colonization, stem biomass was higher relative to other structures.

Losses to vertebrates varied among species, significantly increasing with seed mass. In contrast, insect exclusion did not significantly improve seed recovery. There was no evidence that aliens benefitted from a reduced rate of post-dispersal seed predation. The impacts of seed predators did not differ significantly between natives and exotics, which instead showed very similar responses to predator exclusion treatments.

We investigated the seasonal variation of macrophyte abundance, its influence on flow and channel volume, and the implications of this on stream habitat and functioning in Whakapipi Stream, a typical lowland stream draining a predominantly agricultural catchment. Abundance of macrophytes over the summer was primarily controlled by the phenological cycles of the two dominant species. Mean minimum total macrophyte biomass (36 g m(-2)) and cover (7%) occurred in winter (June and August, respectively), and mean maximum biomass (324 g m(-2)), and cover (79%) occurred in late summer (March and February respectively). Egeria densa comprised the majority of both cover and biomass during the study period, except early summer (December) when Potamogeton crispus was prevalent in the shallow stream reaches. Macrophyte beds had a major impact on summer stream velocities, reducing average velocities by an estimated 41%. Stream cross-sectional area was maintained at relatively stable levels similar to that recorded over winter, when stream discharge was in the order of seven times greater. The mean velocity distribution coefficient (alpha), and Manning's roughness coefficient (n) were dependent on and displayed a positive linear relationship with macrophyte abundance. The velocity distribution coefficient is recommended as a better indicator of macrophyte effects on velocity in natural streams, as it does not assume uniform velocity, channel depth and slope within the stream reach. Our study shows that submerged macrophytes play an important structuring role within the stream during the summer period, where macrophyte beds act as semi-permeable dams, retarding flow velocities and increasing stream depth and cross-sectional area. This promotes habitat heterogeneity by creating a greater range of flow velocity variation, and also provides large stable low-flow areas. Other likely ecosystem effects resulting from macrophyte/velocity interactions include increased sedimentation, potential for nutrient processing and increased primary production, both by macrophytes and attached epiphyton. The complex architecture of submerged macrophytes and their influence on stream flow may also provide an increased diversity of habitat for other aquatic biota. We propose that management of degraded lowland streams such as the Whakapipi Stream to maintain stretches with moderate quantities of submerged macrophytes interspersed with shaded areas would optimise stream health during low summer flows.",Web of Science,Egeria densa;Potamogeton crispus,New Zealand,Aukland,Whakapipi Stream,-37.251,174.964,Field - Observational,lotic,,Impacts;Fundamentals,,,primary

To explore the impacts of NO3-N enrichment, suppression by invasive species, and the interaction of these factors on restored communities, we grew native sedge meadow communities from seed in greenhouse mesocosms and subjected them to NO3-N and invasive species for 4 months. Typha x glauca did not reduce overall native community biomass and actually enhanced Aster spp. biomass. Phalaris arundinacea suppressed growth of the native community to an equal relative extent across all NO3-N levels. The shoot biomass of the entire native community in untreated plots was similar to the P. arundinacea fraction of the treated plots. Phalaris arundinacea demonstrated greater plasticity in root-shoot allocation than the native community over the range of NO3-N inputs. Proportional allocation to root biomass was greater for P. arundinacea than for the native community at all but the highest NO3-N level. Both factors may be important in explaining dominance of P. arundinacea over the native community in a range of fertility conditions.

However, the role that the local species pool plays in determining the invasibility of communities by exotic plants remains to be evaluated. We hypothesized that the richness and abundance of exotic species would be greater in C-4-dominated grassland communities if the local species pool included a larger proportion of exotic species. We also predicted that an increase in the exotic species pool would increase the invasibility of sites thought to be resistant to invasion (annually burned grassland). To test these hypotheses, study plots were established within two long-term (> 20 yr) fire experiments at a tallgrass prairie preserve in NE Kansas (USA). Study plots were surrounded by either a small pool of exotic species (small species pool (SSP) plots; six species) or a larger exotic species pool (large species pool (LSP) plots; 18 species). We found that richness and absolute cover of exotic species were significantly (P < 0.001) lower (<similar to> 70 and 90%, respectively) in annually burned compared to unburned plots, regardless of the size of the exotic species pool. As predicted, exotic species richness was higher (P < 0.001) for LSP plots (3.9 per 250 m(2)) than for SSP plots (0.7 per 250 m(2)); however, absolute cover was unaffected by the size of the exotic species pool. In the absence of fire, plots with a LSP had four times as many exotic species than SSP plots. An increase in the local exotic species pool also increased the invasibility of annually burned grassland. Indeed, richness of exotic plant species in annually burned LSP plots did not differ from unburned plots with a SSP, indicating that a larger pool of exotic species countered the negative effects of fire. These findings have important implications for predicting how the invasion of plant communities may respond to human-induced global changes, such as habitat fragmentation. Community characteristics or factors such as frequent fires in grasslands may impart resistance to invasions by exotic species in large, intact ecosystems. However, when a large pool of exotic species is present, frequent fire may not be sufficient to limit the invasions of exotic plants in fragmented landscapes.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Kansas,Manhattan,39.0833,96.5833,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance;Other,,primary

We used activated carbon to manipulate the effects of root exudates of Centaurea maculosa, a noxious weed in much of western North America, on root elongation rates and growth of the native bunchgrass Festuca idahoensis in order to investigate the relative importance of allelopathy in the total interference of Centaurea. In root observation chambers, Festuca root elongation rates decreased to approximate to 50% of the control, beginning 4 days before contacting Centaurea roots in silica sand. However, when activated carbon, which has a high affinity for adsorbing to organic compounds, was added to the sand the effects of Centaurea roots on Festuca root elongation were reduced.

However, Festuca grown with Centaurea in mixtures of sand and activated carbon were 85% larger than Festuca grown with Centaurea in silica sand without carbon.

Here, we examine characteristics that may influence the success of alien plant invasion in mixed-grass prairie at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in western North Dakota, USA.

If matters of chance related to availability of propagules and transient establishment opportunities determine the success of invasion, park unit and anthropogenic disturbance should better explain the variation in alien plant frequency. If invasibility is more strongly related to biotic or physical characteristics of the native plant communities, models of alien plant occurrence should include vegetation type as an explanatory variable. We examined >1300 transects across all vegetation types in both units of the park. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that the fully parameterized model, including the interaction among vegetation type, disturbance, and park unit, best described the distribution of both total number of alien plants per transect and frequency of alien plants on transects where they occurred. Although all vegetation types were invaded by alien plants, mesic communities had both greater numbers and higher frequencies of alien plants than did drier communities. A strong element of stochasticity, reflected in differences in frequencies of individual species between the two park units, suggests that prediction of risk of invasion will always involve uncertainty.

In this study we present a modification of previous dual-isotope methods that assesses competitive interactions and responses among plants under field conditions.

Clipping Red Brome to remove approximate to 85% of its foliage on the day prior to labelling soil interspaces with P isotopes did not have the desired effect of inhibiting phosphorus uptake by Red Brome.

A hundred and thirteen F-2 individuals were raised and analysed for segregation at 107 RAPDs, six isozyme loci, and one locus determining leaf type. The number, location and magnitude of genes underlying 13 traits were determined by using both interval and composite interval mapping. Two to five QTL affecting one character have been detected. Altogether the 13 quantitative traits produced 48 QTL. The inheritance patterns of trails ranged from those controlled by one QTL with a major effect to those controlled by several QTL with only minor effects. Closely linked QTL, e.g. onset of flowering with rosette leaf number, were interpreted as pleiotropic. Three major QTL account for onset of flowering. These loci were linked to at least three isozyme loci and several other QTL responsible for developmental traits like rosette leaf number. Heritability of quantitative traits, segregation of the leaf type, and segregation of the allozymes was tested in the F-3 generation.

We conducted regional surveys of eastern Kansas reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi. Daphnia lumholtzi was found in five of 35 reservoirs sampled in 1994, and 11 of the 35 reservoirs when re-sampled in 1997. In addition, we sampled 40 small ponds inaccessible to recreational boats, within the watershed of an invaded reservoir. We did not find D.lumholtzi in any of these ponds, suggesting that non-human dispersal mechanisms play an insignificant role in the range expansion of D.lumholtzi throughout the United States. Further experimentation, however, is needed to determine if the absence of D.lumholtzi from these small ponds is due to insufficient dispersal mechanisms or the inability of this invader to successfully colonize following arrival. Daphnia lumholtzi has broad limnological tolerances. However, invaded reservoirs tend to be larger in area, have higher Secchi disk depths, and lower total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a levels relative to non-invaded reservoirs. Analyses of pre-invasion zooplankton communities indicate that D.lumholtzi may be invading reservoirs in which native Daphnia species are rare. While the long-term effects of the invasion of D.lumholtzi are unknown, it has the potential to dominate late summer zooplankton communities in eastern Kansas reservoirs. Therefore, we need to continue to survey and monitor invaded reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi and determine the long-term implications of the introduction of this invader.",Web of Science,Daphnia lumholtzi,USA,Kansas ,Council Grove City,38.68,-96.5,Field - Observational,lentic,,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,herbivore

We quantified the importance of phenological differences for annual carbon gain in both species by estimating total leaf carbon gain from the results of leaf CO2 exchange and changes in plant leaf area. Bunias orientalis achieved almost half of its annual carbon gain in the time between early September and December, when competition for light by other species, like P. hieracioides, is low.

However, to this date, observation and experimental data have shown positive or negative relationships between plant community diversity and invasibility. Studies of biological invasions proposed several others mechanisms explaining invasions: disturbances, presence of empty niches and interactions with others community trophic levels. The role of plant diversity can be decomposed in two factors: is specific richness per se and/or the diversity of functional groups that lead to invasion resistance of communities? A study carried out in old fields of Montpellier country showed a general picture of invasion and its complexity in this country. Our observations of these invasion patterns confirmed the difficulties to observe clear relationships with their diversity. We then resorted to semi-controlled field experiments. We sowed annual old field communities with different levels of diversity: variation in species richness, variation in functional richness and variation in functional identities for a fixed Functional richness. Demographic and vegetative parameters of two exotic probes transplanted into these communities, Conyza bonariensis and C.canadensis, were measured along their life cycle. Primary community functioning parameters of the model ecosystems were measured simultaneously. Species richness had little effect on performance of the two Conyza species.

Reintroduction of flooding in the southwestern United States is being promoted as a means of reestablishing Populus deltoides subsp. wislizenii, but flooding can also promote establishment of an introduced, invasive species, Tamarix ramosissima. We investigated competition between Populus and Tamarix at the seedling stage to aid in characterizing the process by which Tamarix may invade and to determine the potential ability of Populus to establish itself with competitive pressure from Tamarix. We planted seedlings of Tamarix and Populus in five ratios at three densities for a total of 15 treatments. The growth response of each species was measured in terms of height, above-ground biomass, and tissue concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous. These measurements across treatments were modeled as three-dimensional response surfaces. For both species, Populus density was more important than Tamarix density for determining growth response. Both species were negatively affected by increasing numbers of Populus seedlings. Due to the large size of the native Populus, we predict that its superior competitive ability can lead to its dominance when conditions allow native establishment.

In a recent study conspicuous changes in vegetation composition have been reported in climatically sensitive areas with particular boundary position as e. g. the Insubrian area in southern Switzerland. More than a dozen exotic species recently started to colonise and in some places even to dominate - forest understorey vegetation. All I:he exotic species share equal characteristics (evergreen broad-leaved or laurophyllous plant functional type) and a synchronous pattern of dispersal in time and space. This stresses the fact that external factors may determine the process. Climatic data from local meteorological stations are evaluated with special regard to limiting climatic parameters for laurophyllous species. With this background, climatic forcing must be considered as one of the major contributing factors for this increasing tendency of exotic species dispersal and their capability to establish in forests.

Elton's hypothesis. supported by theory, experiment, and anecdotal evidence, suggests that an important determinant of invasion success is resident biodiversity, arguing that high diversity increases the competitive environment of communities and makes them more difficult to invade. Observational studies of plant invasions, however, find little support for this hypothesis and argue strongly against it. Lack of control of extrinsic factors (e.g., disturbance. climate, or soil fertility) that covary with biodiversity and invasion in observational studies makes it difficult to determine if their findings truly refute Elton's hypothesis. We examined performance of Crepis tectorum (an invasive, annual composite weed) in experimental prairie grassland plots and greenhouse plant assemblages in which resident species richness was directly manipulated. Under these conditions, unlike observational studies, no covarying extrinsic factors could interfere with interpreting results. We found a strong inverse association between resident diversity and invader performance as predicted by Elton's hypothesis. Higher resident diversity increased crowding, decreased available light, and decreased available nutrients all of which increased the competitive environment of diverse plant assemblages and reduced C. tectorum success. Examination of individual resident species impacts on C. tectorum performance demonstrated that this diversity effect was not due to the sampling effect. These results suggest that both Elton's hypothesis and its competitive mechanism may operate in nature, but covarying extrinsic factors may obscure the negative impact of diversity on invader success.",Web of Science,Crepis tectorum,United States,Minnesota,Cedar Creek Natural History Area,45.406646,-93.200798,Field - Observational;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

Many sediment characteristics were significantly different in urban streams. At least one exotic plant species was found in each urban stream sampled, but none were found in the non-urban streams. The presence of exotic species led to the overall number and abundance of plant species being significantly higher in urban streams. Interestingly, the number and abundance of native species at the urban sites were the same as non-urban sites, but a different suite of species was usually present. This suggests that urban streams favour exotic plants and certain native plants that are adapted to the modified conditions. The differences between the plant communities in the urban and non-urban streams appeared to be associated with the increased level of nutrients in the urban stream sediment. Several multivariate techniques were used to assess the relative importance of individual nutrients, but no nutrients were directly associated with the observed differences. In particular, total phosphorus levels were less important in explaining the vegetation patterns than a combination of nutrients.

I first examined the mortality and distribution of the snails during 2 natural experiments in Bolinas salt marsh (Marin Co., California, USA) that exposed the snails to high bacteria levels and low oxygen conditions for prolonged periods (>3 wk). Second, I conducted 2 laboratory experiments designed to quantify the rates and mechanisms of snail mortality related to bacterial activity. In both the field and the lab, B, attramentaria was significantly more resistant to death by low oxygen. Lab experiments demonstrated that indirect effects of bacteria, i.e., low oxygen levels las opposed to direct infection by bacteria), were responsible for the high mortality rate of C. californica. In the field, C, californica seemed able to mitigate effects of hypoxia by migrating away from sources of high stress, but only when the harmful bacterial activity was highly localized. Ultimately this study illustrates that stress from microbial action differentially affects the 2 competing species and thus contributes to the invader's documented displacement of the native in marshes where they co-occur.

Crow pellets, containing regurgitated bones and viable seeds of Opuntia spp., and other alien and indigenous plants, are most common around such perch sites. Crows are frequently associated with roads in the Karoo because they scavenge on road kills in the Karoo as well as feeding on fruits, insects and reptiles in road verges.

Representatives of families from two populations were collected within a day or two of each other, reared in a common environment, and then released to sea from each of two different rivers, while other family representatives were retained in fresh water to maturity. The date of maturation of fish held in fresh water and the dates of return from the ocean and maturation of fish released to sea all showed significant differences between the two populations and among families within populations. The very high heritabilities and genetic correlations estimated for migration and maturation date indicated that these traits would respond rapidly to selection.

Bythotrephes cederstroemi (Crustacea: Onychopoda: Cercopagidae) is an introduced invertebrate predator currently spreading through the Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. We examined a previously unsuspected way in which B. cederstroemi may be dispersed by fish by their consumption of diapausing eggs. 2. Ninety-four percentage of the mature B. cederstroemi diapausing eggs consumed by fish were egested apparently intact. This proportion is considerably above previous estimates for the ephippial eggs of Daphnia. The hatching success of diapausing eggs was compared among four categories: (a) eggs released naturally by B. cederstroemi (control, 73% hatched) (b) eggs released during 'stressful confinement' (46% hatched) (c) eggs dissected from dead females (13% hatched) and (d) eggs recovered from faecal pellets following consumption by fish (viable gut passage experiment, 41% hatched). 3. Samples of small fish and B. cederstroemi were collected simultaneously. Examination of gut contents revealed that fish contained B. cederstroemi diapausing eggs and that B. cederstroemi bearing resting eggs were consumed selectively over those without eggs. Moreover, fish selected B. cederstroemi bearing mature rather than immature diapausing eggs. 4. The fact that diapausing eggs survive gut passage is important for the dispersal of B. cederstroemi. Fish often move between the pelagic and littoral zones of lakes and may thus disperse diapausing eggs widely. Fish may also move between lakes connected by river systems and can be caught and passively dispersed by anglers or piscivorous birds. Our results demonstrate the potential for fish to act as vectors in the spread of B. cederstroemi.",Web of Science,Bythotrephes cederstroemi (Crustacea: Onychopoda: Cercopagidae) ,United States,Michigan,Lake Michigamme,46.5,-88.1,Field - Observational;Lab,lentic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,predator

Populations known to be characteristically acyanogenic, cyanogenic or to exhibit within-population variation were surveyed for cyanogenesis, plant size, and the presence and identity of invertebrate plant visitors. A developmental series of 10 leaves from a shoot of each surveyed plant was analyzed, using image analysis techniques, for the type and extent of damage present. We also surveyed two additional plant populations for the presence of plants with eggs or larvae of Euptoieta hegesia Cramer, a Nymphalid butterfly that is potentially the most damaging herbivore of T. ulmifolia, and a paired comparison analysis of cyanogenesis in plants with the herbivore versus plants without the herbivore was conducted. We found that T. ulmifolia are attacked by a reasonably diverse insect fauna, but a relatively small suite of specialist herbivores that are seemingly undeterred by cyanogenesis inflicts most of the leaf damage. Cyanogenesis does appear to play a role in determining the types, numbers, and presence of generalist herbivores found within and between populations. Tissue loss sustained by plants varies both within and between populations; however, the proportion of leaf tissue lost due to herbivory is low, ranging from only 1-9% on average, and does not appear to be correlated with cyanogenesis in a consistent way. An analysis of covariance did, however, reveal that cyanogenesis has a significant effect on both plant height and number of shoots per plant. These results suggest that cyanogenesis might afford protection against herbivory from generalizing herbivores.",Web of Science,Turnera ulmifolia L.,,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Novel Weapons,,primary

To understand life history traits of four successful invasive Melastomataceae, two shade-intolerant herbs (Arthrostema ciliatum and Tibouchina herbacea) and two shade-tolerant woody species (Clidemia hirta, a shrub, and Miconia calvescens, a tree) were subjected to three light levels and two watering regimes in a greenhouse. Plant height, leaf number and area, biomass allocation, relative growth rate (RGR), carbon assimilation (A), leaf nutrient content, leaf construction costs (CC), specific leaf mass (SLM), and leaf spectral properties were determined at the end of the experimental period. Plant size, total biomass, RGR, A, CC, and SLM decreased, whereas leaf light transmittance and leaf N increased under low light in all species. The effects of water stress were weaker than light-stress effects. Relative growth rate of herbs grown in sun and partial shade (0.046 and 0.033 g g(-1) d(-1), respectively) was higher than in the woody species (0.027 and 0.020 g g(-1) d(-1)). Woody species allocated more biomass to leaf production than herbs, which allocated more biomass to stem production. Shade increased allocation of biomass to leaves, and water stress increased the root-shoot ratio in all species. Partial shade increased leaf area ratios more in the herbs (140%) than in woody species (68%). Miconia calvescens and C. hirta had higher leaf absorbance (92%) than both herbs (79%). Maximum A under all light treatments was similar in all species, and there was substantial acclimation to the different light levels. Leaf construction cost was higher-in the apparently long-lived leaves of the woody species. Relative growth rate, carbon allocation, and SLM showed larger changes to light and water stress than A and related photosynthetic parameters. All species showed responses qualitatively similar to those of other tropical species including the high acclimation potential to light, but the herbs exhibited the largest quantitative responses. When compared with a large group of native species, the four melastomes appear to be better suited to capture and use light, which is consistent with their rapid spread in mesic and disturbed Hawaiian environments.",Web of Science,Arthrostema ciliatum; Tibouchina herbacea; Clidemia hirta; Miconia calvescens,United States,Hawaii,Maui; Ohau,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Preadaptation to Climate,Broad Tolerances,primary

Caruel (Scrophulariaceae), were examined in habitats where introduced, mixed introduced plus native, or solely native species provided potential hosts. Presence of haustoria on host roots confirmed parasitism of 17 introduced and ten native taxa across the sites investigated. Paired plots, one with all hosts removed early in the season, the other left intact, showed overall increases in shoot dry matter of the parasites over 3 months of growth. Results indicated a substantial growth benefit to the parasite from continued access to introduced and indigenous plant species, although the parasite continued growing to a limited extent after removal of hosts. Carbon isotope discrimination values (delta(13)C) were consistently more negative for parasites than for associated hosts, and more negative for parasites in plots containing hosts than in plots from which hosts had been removed. Values for delta(15)N discrimination of shoot dry matter of parasites lay mostly within the range of those of hosts. The delta(13)C data suggested poorer water use efficiency of parasite than hosts, while corresponding delta(15)N data indicated particularly effective uptake of N-containing compounds from the N-2-fixing host, Lotus angustissimus. Where the parasite had access to only one or a few closely related hosts, the composition of the soluble amino fraction of its leaves generally matched that of foliage of host(s). However, in some instances the parasite accumulated certain amino compounds to a much greater or lesser relative extent than did its partner host(s). Where many hosts were being exploited, compositional features of the soluble amino fraction of the parasite suggested major access to nitrogenous solutes from specific hosts.

Using data from the literature for 184 sites around the world, I found that nature reserves had one-half of the exotic fraction of sites outside reserves, and island sites had nearly three: times the exotic fraction of mainland sites. However, the exotic fraction and the number of exotics were also dependent on site area, and this had to be taken into account to make valid comparisons between sites. The number of native species was used as a surrogate fur site area and habitat diversity. Nearly 70% of the variation in the number of exotic species was accounted for by a multiple regression containing the following predictors: the number of native species, whether the site was an island or on the mainland, and whether or not it was a nature reserve. After controlling for scale, there were significant differences among biomes, but not continents in their level of invasion. Multiple biome regions and temperate agricultural or urban sites were among the most invaded biomes, and deserts and savannas were among the least. However, there was considerable within-group variation in the mean degree of invasion. Scale-controlled analysis also showed that the New World is significantly more invaded than the Old World, but only when sire native richness (probably a surrogate fur habitat diversity) is factored our. Contrary to expectation, communities richer in native species had more, not fewer, exotics. For mainland sites, the degree of invasion increased with latitude, but there was no such relationship for islands. Although islands are more invaded than mainland sites, this is apparently not because of low native species richness, as the islands in this data set were no less rich in native species than were mainland sites of similar area. The number of exotic species in nature reserves increases with the number of visitors. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about relative invasibility, invasion potential, or the roles of dispersal and disturbance from any of these results.

To determine how these factors influence the establishment of the invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea L.

We found that genotype strongly influenced survivorship, but there was no significant effect of environment on survivorship. However, environmental conditions did significantly affect growth. Individual plants produced more aboveground and belowground biomass when grown singly than they did when grown with competitors. The identity of neighboring competitors had no effect. Although genotype had no significant efffect, there was a significant genotype x environment interaction. Clone 1 produced more root biomass than either clone 2 or clone 3 when there was no or little competition, but in competitive neighborhoods, clone 3 allocated relatively more biomass to roots than to shoots. Under ideal conditions in the greenhouse, clone 2 produced more tillers than the other two clones. Based on these results, it appears that clone 1 may have an advantage under sparse vegetative cover, but clone 3 may have a competitive advantage in highly competitive neighborhoods because it could preferentially allocate more biomass to roots.

Tree size differed more within than among dune habitats, indicating that the coarse-scale differences in environmental factors among habitats, such as distance from the lake, soil moisture, and wind exposure, account for only some of the variation in growth.

In this complex environmental matrix, where annual precipitation is higher than 1500 mm, we predicted that invasive species, as a group, will have leaf traits, such as higher SLA and A and lower leaf CC, which may result in more efficient capture of limiting resources (use more resources at a lower carbon cost) than native species. Overall, invasive species had higher SLA and A, and lower CC than native species, consistent with our prediction. SLA and foliar N and P were 22.5%, 30.5%, and 37.5% higher, respectively, in invasive species compared to native ones. Light-saturated photosynthesis was higher for invasive species (9.59 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than for native species (7.31 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), and the difference was larger when A was expressed on a mass basis. Leaf construction costs, on the other hand, were lower for the invasive species (1.33 equivalents of glucose g(-1)) than for native species (1.37). This difference was larger when CC was expressed on an area basis. The trends in the above traits were maintained when groups of ecologically equivalent native and invasive species (i.e., sharing similar life history traits and growing in the same habitat) were compared.:Foliar N and P were significantly higher in invasive species across all growth forms. Higher N may partially explain the higher A of invasive species. Despite relatively high N, the photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency of invasive species was 15% higher than that of native species.

In the southwestern United States, increased abundance of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa) has been attributed to heavy grazing by livestock. Here, we test the hypothesis that P. glandulosa invasion of grasslands requires, first, reductions in herbaceous biomass and density such as those that accompany livestock grazing and, second, episodes of high soil moisture availability. No combination of grass density (nonmanipulated or reduced 50%) or defoliation (none, moderate, heavy) significantly affected P. glandulosa seedling emergence within a watering regime (natural and supplemented) at our field site in semiarid southern Texas. Seedling emergence on plots receiving only natural rainfall was high (42%), despite the fact that precipitation was substantially below normal. Supplemental watering, to generate moisture levels approximating years of unusually high annual rainfall, increased emergence to 59%. Seedling survival after 2 yr was high (62-77%) and statistically comparable across the density, defoliation, and watering treatments. Net photosynthesis (A(n)) of 1-yr-old seedlings was enhanced by supplemental watering, but reductions in grass density or biomass had little effect on seedling A(n) or xylem water potential. Height, aboveground biomass, and leaf area were comparable among 1- and 2-yr-old seedings across all density, defoliation, and watering combinations. High seedling emergence and survival on unwatered plots, even during a *drought year,* suggests that Prosopis recruitment is not contingent upon unusual or episodic rainfall. Reductions in biomass and density of herbaceous vegetation had no influence on seedling emergence, growth, or survival, suggesting that Prosopis invasion is minimally influenced by grass competition. Historic grazing at this site appears to have altered herbaceous composition and reduced above- and belowground biomass production below the threshold level required for competitive exclusion of woody vegetation. Such data suggest that rates and patterns of seed dispersal may be the primary determinants of P. glandulosa encroachment on present-day landscapes in semiarid regions. Minimizing livestock dispersal of seed (in the case of leguminous shrubs) and maintenance of an effective fire regime (through production of fine fuels) may be crucial for sustaining herbaceous composition and production in grazed systems prone to invasion by unpalatable woody plants.",Web of Science,Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa,United States,Texas,Texas Agricultural Experiment Station,27.6667,-98.2,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Savanna,Invasion Hyp.,Fluctuating Resources;Disturbance,,primary

Our specific objectives were to assess the temporal and spatial patterns of exotic plant species in a native grassland in Kansas (USA) and to determine the factors that control exotic species abundance and richness (i.e., invasibility). Exotic species (90% C-3 plants) comprised approximately 10% of the flora, and their turnover was relatively high (30%) over the 15-year period. We found that disturbances significantly affected the abundance and richness of exotic species. In particular, long-term annually burned watersheds had lower cover of exotic species than unburned watersheds, and fire reduced exotic species richness by 80-90%. Exotic and native species richness were positively correlated across sites subjected to different fire (r = 0.72) and grazing (r = 0.67) treatments, and the number of exotic species was lowest on sites with the highest productivity of C-4 grasses (i.e., high dominance).

Moreover, a significant positive relationship between exotic and native species richness was observed within a disturbance regime (annually burned sites, r = 0.51; unburned sites, r = 0.59).

We evaluated emerging patterns of population growth and genetic structure during a full period of population development under typical site conditions (anthropogenic disturbance) and their possible consequences for the invasion potential of the species. The population has grown rapidly and continuously (though with slowing geometric population increase) during the 9 years since its foundation, filling the space available in the study area. Genetic variation (RAPD markers) was already high in the founder cohorts and remained at the same level throughout population development (variance fluctuations < 15%). Both results may be related to the mowing management at the site which seems to promote population growth of B. orientalis relative to other co-occuring species and to prevent the genetic drift and the development of spatial genetic structure that would be expected under isolation-by-distance models. Large founder plants had comparatively low genetic variance and were more closely related to younger cohorts than were small founder plants, indicating that selection acted during population development. Overall, the current anthropogenic disturbance regimes may contribute to high genetic variability by artificially increasing gene flow and thereby promoting the adaptability of invasive species to the often unpredictable conditions at disturbed sites. Our approach using retrospective demographic investigation allows the detection of spatio-temporal microscale patterns in genetic and phenotypic variation. Thus it allows a thorough understanding of local invasions of perennial herbaceous plants.",Web of Science,Bunias orientalis,Germany,Unterfranken,,49.85,9.85,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General;Disturbance,,primary

Mycorrhizae had no direct effect on either species, but mycorrhizae increased C. maculosa's negative effect on F. idahoensis. When competing with C. maculosa, nonmycorrhizal F. idahoensis were 171% larger than they were when mycorrhizae were present. In a second experiment, C. maculosa grown with larger F. idahoensis were 66% larger, in the presence of AM fungi, than when AM fungi were absent. Centaurea maculosa biomass was not affected by AM fungi, in either phosphorus treatment, in the absence of F. idahoensis. Root:shoot ratios differed between phosphorus treatments, but this difference seemed to be a result of slower growth in the organic phosphorus treatment. Our results were unusual in that the direct effects of mycorrhizae on both species were weak, but the indirect effect of AM fungi on the interactions between C. maculosa and F. idahoensis was strong.

To understand their competitive relationships, we compared biomass production and allocation, plant architecture and phenology, net photosynthesis (Pn), water relations, and nutrient content under fire and simulated herbivory between two C-4 grasses, the native Trachypogon plumosus and the introduced Hyparrhenia rufa from a seasonal savanna in Venezuela. All variables were strongly influenced by the rainfall regime. Huparrhenia,pan produced bigger plants (in mass and size) with a large proportion of mass (>75%) allocated to leaves and culms. Its biomass production was more affected by fire than by defoliation. In contrast, Trachypogon was more affected by defoliation than by fire which promoted a flush of leaf growth even in the dry season. Fire caused up to 85% mortality in Hyparrhenia but none in Trachypogon, where it increased inflorescence production. However, fire promoted abundant seed germination and fast seedling growth in Hyparrhenia, enabling it to colonize new areas. During the growing season Trachypogon,pogon had higher Pn and lower leaf water potential (Psi) than Hyparrhenia but differences among treatments were not significant for either grass. Pn of Trachypogon ceased at a lower Psi(-3.0 MPa) than in Hyparrhenia (-2.0 MPa), indicating its higher tolerance to water stress. During the dry season, Trachypogon,pogon leaves remained alive and retained low Pn. Leaf nutrient content was higher during the rainy season in both species. Differences in Pn could not explain the higher seasonal biomass production of Hyparrhenia.

Here we describe how herbivore-driven mortality of a native N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), increases soil N and light availability, which promotes Invasion by introduced grasses to the detriment of a native plant community. Soils under live and dead lupine stands contained large amounts of total N, averaging 3.14 mg N/g dry mass of soil (398 g/m(2)) and 3.45 mg N/g dry mass of soil (438 g/m(2)), respectively, over four years. In contrast, similar lupine-free soil was low in N and averaged only 1.66 mg N/g dry mass of soil (211 g/m(2)) over three years. The addition of N fertilizer to lupine-free soil produced an 81% increase in aboveground plant biomass compared to plots unamended with N. Mean rates of net N mineralization were higher under live lupine and where mass die-off of lupine had occurred compared to soils free of bush lupine. At all sites, only 2.5-4.2% of the total soil N pool was mineralized annually. Soil enriched by lupine is not available to colonists while lupines are alive. The dense canopy of lupine shades soil under shrubs, reducing average photon-flux density in late spring from 1725 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) (full sunlight) to 13 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) (underneath shrubs). Stand die-off due to insect herbivory exposed this bare, enriched soil. In January, when annual plants are establishing, average photon-flux density under dead lupines killed by insect herbivores was 370 mu mol m(-2) . s(-1), compared to the photon-flux density under live lupines of the same age, which averaged 83 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1). The availability of bare, N-rich patches of soil enabled nonnative annuals (primarily Lolium multiflorum and Bromus diandrus) to colonize sites, grow rapidly, and dominate the plant assemblage until lupines reestablished after several years. The N content of these grasses was significantly greater than the N content of the mostly native plants that occupied adjacent coastal prairie devoid of bush lupine. Between 57 and 70% of the net amount of N mineralized annually was taken up by introduced grasses and subsequently returned to the soil upon the death of these annuals. Even in the absence of further N inputs, we estimate that it would take at least 25 yr to reduce the soil N pool by 50%, indicating that the reestablishment of the native prairie flora is likely to be long term.",Web of Science,Many,United States,California,University of California Bodega Marine Reserve,39.436193,-123.134766,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Negative biotic interactions by resident species may prevent successful invaders from becoming pests. Few experimental data are available on the presence and significance of such biotic resistance other than predation or competition. This study addresses the role of habitat structure provided by a native eelgrass (Zostera marina) canopy on growth and survival of the non-indigenous mussel Musculista senhousia, a habitat-modifying gregarious suspension feeder with strong effects on native infauna and eelgrass. In 2 southern California bays, a series of transplantation experiments using tagged mussels revealed that inside an eelgrass canopy, Musculista growth rates were reduced by more than half in 3 of 4 experiments compared to adjacent unvegetated areas. Musculista survival also decreased inside the vegetation in a 4-mo experiment. As one element of habitat structure, we tested the effects of eelgrass parch size, using natural (1 site) and planted (1 site) eelgrass patches of defined sizes. Growth rates of Musculista were highest outside the veneration and decreased as eelgrass patch size increased. As a potential mechanism for the canopy effects, we suggest that Musculista receives less food inside the vegetation. In the experimental plots, the presence and spatial extent of the macrophyte canopy strongly affected near bottom (10 cm) horizontal water flow assessed with a direct dye tracking method. Reduced mussel growth rates were linearly associated with lower water flow, and presumably, food flux. Over a period of 7 mo, food resources (particulate chlorophyll a) were consistently lower 1 and 5 cm above the sea floor inside eelgrass patches compared to the sand Aat. The reduction in food availability matched the growth reduction of Musculista. Also, mussel condition (dry flesh mass/shell mass) was worse in individuals growing in eelgrass than in the sand Aat. Previous experiments revealed that dense beds of Musculista impede the rhizome growth and vegetative propagation of eelgrass, yet mussels attain abundances sufficient for interference only if eelgrass beds are patchy. Thus, anthropogenic disturbances on eelgrass beds, which often result in meadow fragmentation, and the proliferation of Musculista may have synergistic negative effects on the persistence of eelgrass beds.",Web of Science,Musculista senhousia,United States,California,,,,Field - Experimental,estuarine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Empty Niche,,filter
2170,"Stohlgren, TJ; Schell, LD; Vanden Heuvel, B",1999,How grazing and soil quality affect native and exotic plant diversity in rocky mountain grasslands,journal,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,9,1,45,64,"We used multiscale plots to sample vascular plant diversity and soil characteristics in and adjacent to 26 long-term grazing exclosure sites in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, USA. The exclosures were 7-60 yr old (31.2 +/- 2.5 yr, mean +/- 1 SE). Plots were also randomly placed in the broader landscape in open rangeland in the same vegetation type at each site to assess spatial variation in grazed landscapes. Consistent sampling in the nine National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, and other management units yielded data from 78 1000-m(2) plots and 780 1-m(2) subplots. We hypothesized that native species richness would be lower in the exclosures than in grazed sites, due to competitive exclusion in the absence of grazing. We also hypothesized that grazed sites would have higher native and exotic species richness compared to ungrazed areas, due to disturbance (i.e., the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis) and the conventional wisdom that grazing may accelerate weed invasion. Both hypotheses were soundly rejected. Although native species richness in l-mz subplots was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in grazed sites, we found nearly identical native or exotic species richness in 1000-m(2) plots in exclosures (31.5 +/- 2.5 native and 3.1 +/- 0.5 exotic species), adjacent grazed plots (32.6 +/- 2.8 native and 3.2 +/- 0.6 exotic species), and randomly selected grazed plots (31.6 +/- 2.9 native and 3.2 +/- 0.6 exotic species). We found no significant differences in species diversity (Hill's diversity indices, N1 and N2), evenness (Hill's ratio of evenness, E5), cover of various life-forms (grasses, forbs, and shrubs), soil texture, or soil percentage of N and C between grazed and ungrazed sites at the 1000-m(2) plot scale. The species lists of the long-ungrazed and adjacent grazed plots overlapped just 57.9 +/- 2.8%. This difference in species composition is commonly attributed solely to the difference in grazing regimes. However, the species lists between pairs of grazed plots (adjacent and distant 1000-m(2) plots) in the same vegetation type overlapped just 48.6 +/- 3.6%, and the ungrazed plots and distant grazed plots overlapped 49.4 +/- 3.6%. Differences in vegetation and soils between grazed and ungrazed sites were minimal in most cases, but soil characteristics and elevation were strongly correlated with native and exotic plant diversity in the study region. For the 78 1000-m(2) plots, 59.4% of the variance in total species richness was explained by percentage of silt (coefficient = 0.647, t = 5.107, P < 0.001), elevation (coefficient = 0.012, t = 5.084, P < 0.001), and total foliar cover (coefficient = 0.110, t = 2.104, P < 0.039). Only 12.8% of the variance in exotic species cover (log(10)cover) was explained by percentage of clay (coefficient = -0.011, t = -2.878, P < 0.005), native species richness (coefficient = -0.011, t = -2.156, P < 0.034), and log(10)N (coefficient = 2.827, t = 1.860, P < 0.067). Native species cover and exotic species richness and frequency were also significantly positively correlated with percentage of soil N at the 1000-m(2) plot scale. Our research led to five broad generalizations about current levels of grazing in these Rocky Mountain grasslands: (1) grazing probably has little effect on native species richness at landscape scales; (2) grazing probably has little effect on the accelerated spread of most exotic plant species at landscape scales; (3) grazing affects local plant species and life-form composition and cover, but spatial variation is considerable; (4) soil characteristics, climate, and disturbances may have a greater effect on plant species diversity than do current levels of grazing; and (5) few plant species show consistent, directional responses to grazing or cessation of grazing.",Web of Science,Many,United States,Colorado; Wyoming; Montana; South Dakota,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

H. pilosella was present on >80% of all plots, but was at an early stage of invasion in one catchment (<5% cover) and dominant in the other (25% cover). Classification and ordination revealed strong between-catchment differences in community composition that reflected differences in environment (soil fertility and rainfall), disturbance history (animal populations and burning), and the stage of invasion by H. pilosella. In both catchments H. pilosella tended to be least abundant on the wettest, driest, and most fertile soils. However, such relationships were weak. Generalised additive models and regression showed that in the earlier stage of invasion individual site factors explained less than 20% of the variation in H. pilosella cover. Topographic position and slope (both indicative of soil moisture) were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 32% of the variation. In the later stage of invasion individual factors explained up to 33% of the variation. Topsoil sulphur, slope, and topsoil calcium were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 53% of the variation. Between-catchment comparisons highlighted the inter-related roles of environment, disturbance history, geographic location, availability of H. pilosella propagules, and stage of invasion in more fully explaining the abundance of H. pilosella. Of five models that have been proposed for Hieracium invasion, the: *grassland decline* model best incorporated the inter-related factors that influence spatial and temporal variation in H. pilosella abundance in the study area. This model concentrates on identifying predisposing and trigger factors that increase the likelihood of invasion and accounts for multiple causes and interactions by specifying five key factors that influence the ability of a plant species to invade existing vegetation: environment, disturbance, vegetation structure and composition, life history attributes of the invader, and the availability of invading propagules.

Our study addresses mechanisms of hybridization between a rare invader, smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and the common native California cordgrass (S. foliosa) in the salt marshes of San Francisco Bay. These species are wind-pollinated and flower in summer. The invader produced 21-fold the viable pollen of the native, and 28% of invader pollen germinated on native stigmas (1.5-fold the rate of the native's own pollen). Invader pollen increased the seed set of native plants almost eightfold over that produced with native pollen, while native pollen failed to increase seed set of the invader. This pollen swamping and superior airing ability by the invader could lead to serial genetic assimilation of a very large native population. Unlike California cordgrass, smooth cordgrass can grow into low intertidal habitats and cover open mud necessary to foraging shorebirds, marine life, navigation, and flood control in channels. To the extent that intertidal range of the hybrids is more similar to the invader than to the native parent, introgression will lead to habitat ross for shore birds and marine life as well to genetic pollution of native California cordgrass.",Web of Science,Spartina alterniflora,USA,California,San Francisco Bay,,,Field - Observational,estuarine,,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,primary

Visually evident anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., artificial regeneration, logging, prescribed burning, and grazing by livestock), if any, were recorded on each plot. In each of the seven regions we quantified (1) the percentage of the number of species and total cover comprised of alien species, (2) the difference in these percentages for disturbed and undisturbed plots, and (3) the origin or native range for the alien species. The percentage of alien species ranged from approximately 4.5% (Colorado) to approximately 13.2% (California). The percentage of alien species cover ranged from approximately 1.5% in Colorado to 25% in California. In five regions, species introduced from temperate Eurasia comprised the largest proportion of alien species and cover. In the Southeast, species introduced from far eastern and subtropical Asia dominated the alien flora. In the Mid-Atlantic, the majority of alien species was Eurasian and the majority of alien species cover consisted of far eastern and subtropical Asian species. The proportion of plots in which at least one alien species was recorded was significantly higher in disturbed than undisturbed plots in the Southeast and marginally significantly higher (p = 0.053) in the Northeast.

Exotic species were a minor component (< 1% vegetation cover) in the more recently logged coupes and were not present in 10-year-old coupes and the spar-stage and mature forests.

Our alternate hypothesis was that riparian zones high in native plant species richness and cover would monopolize available resources and resist invasion by exotic species. We gathered nested-scale vegetation data from 40 1 m(2)subplots (nested in four 1000 m(2) plots) in both riparian and upland sites at four study areas in Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota (a total of 320 1 m(2)subplots and 32 1000 m(2) plots). At the 1 m(2) scale, mean foliar cover of native species was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in riparian zones (36.3% +/- 1.7%) compared to upland sites (28.7% +/- 1.5%), but at this small scale there were no consistent patterns of native and exotic species richness among the four management areas. Mean exotic species cover was slightly higher in upland sites compared to riparian sites (9.0% +/- 3.8% versus 8.2% +/- 3.0% cover). However, mean exotic species richness and cover were greater in the riparian zones than upland sites in three of four management areas. At the 1000 m(2) scale, mean exotic species richness was also significantly greater (P < 0.05) in riparian zones (7.8 +/- 1.0 species) compared to upland sites (4.8 +/- 1.0 species) despite the heavy invasion of one upland site. For all 32 plots combined, 21% of the variance in exotic species richness was explained by positive relationships with soil % silt (t = 1.7, P = 0.09) and total foliar cover (t = 2.4, P = 0.02). Likewise, 26% of the variance in exotic species cover (log(10) cover) was explained by positive relationships with soil % silt (t = 2.3, P = 0.03) and total plant species richness (t = 2.5, P = 0.02).

Exotic species cover (log(10) cover) was positively correlated with log(10)% N in the soil (r = 0.61, P = 0.11) at landscape scales.

The variation in population density in both the introduced and source populations is limited by density-dependent reduction in fecundity and female survival. However, variation in the introduced population's density was increased due to host plant defoliation that resulted in overcompensating density-dependent mortality. In years with high larval density plants were defoliated and this increased adult mortality during the prehibernation period.

We initially show that exotic species are more likely than natives to occur in riparian zones, roadsides, and disturbed sites, and less likely to occur in grassland. The relationship between exotic origins and disturbed sites disappears when phylogenetic dependence is removed from the analyses; in contrast, the other associations persist following phylogenetic detrending, indicating that aliens and their native relatives consistently differ in their ability to exploit riparian, roadside, and grassland habitats.

Models of invading species, however, often do not include a dynamic component of risk. North American freshwater mussels are at risk, of fouling by the introduced zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Predictions of the risk to native mussel communities of invasion by the zebra mussel can help prioritize conservation efforts. We present a model for the spatial analysis of zebra mussel spread that allows the characterization of relative risk of infestation to the high-quality mussel communities of Illinois streams. A gravity model, constrained at origin and destination, was parameterized with data on boat use at 120 boat landings in Illinois. The risk of spread of zebra mussels depends on the number of boat trips from infested waters, which in turn depends on distance from an infested water, boat use at a site, and the position of a lake within a river system. Habitats supporting a high diversity of native mussels and threatened and endangered species are at risk of infestation from reservoirs upstream. Invasion of inland lakes and reservoirs in Illinois is predicted to occur first at areas of high boat use close to currently, infested waters, including the Fox Chain of Lakes, followed by central Illinois reservoirs. These reservoirs will act as stepping stones, facilitating the invasion of lakes upstream of critical native mussel habitats. Efforts to protect waters that center on prevention of the initial invasion of stepping-stone lakes could significantly reduce the risk of infestation. Education and inspection efforts are predicted to be more effective than quarantine because quarantines would displace boat traffic to critical habitats.

Previous work on a small population of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) invading San Francisco Bay, California found that most clones flower prolifically but set little or no seed, while a few clones have high rates of viable seed sell producing most of the seeds in the population. This study first identifies recruitment from seeds as the main source of new smooth cordgrass plants during invasion and then tests the influence of growing conditions and pollination treatment on viable seed set among clones established in San Francisco Bay. Field transplants indicated that a clone's seed set rate was not strongly dependent on its site of establishment. Low and high nutrient greenhouse treatments also had little effect on viable seed set rates within most clones. In contrast, pollination treatment (self-pollination or outcrossing) had a major effect on viable seed set rates. Most clones had high seed set rates after outcross-pollination, but clones varied widely in their selfing capacity. Zero or low viable self-seed set rates were most common; however, a few clones had high viable self-seed set rates, comparable to outcross seed set rates. A clone's selfing capacity was significantly correlated across years (r = 0.89, P < 0.001), and capacity to set viable self-pollinated seeds in the greenhouse was significantly correlated with the clone's rate of viable seed set in the field (r(s) = 0.74, P < 0.005). In this growing population where cross-pollination is limited, only the clones with high selfing ability had high viable seed set rates in the field.

Our goals were to determine (1) whether high dams reduce or eliminate steam corridor permeability with respect to migration, (2) the extent to which permeability is a function of spillway discharge, (3) the relative roles of native fauna and disturbance suppression (in this case, river regulation) as predictors of success by exotic fishes, and (4) the uniformity and extent of obligate amphidromy in this assemblage. We sampled adults and juveniles of shrimps and fishes in Puerto Rican streams via electrofishing and sampled shrimp larvae with drift nets. Replicate stream reaches were assigned to the following five categories: undammed, above or below dams, and with or without water released over spillways. Dams without such discharge were impermeable barriers that eliminated all native fish and shrimp fauna from upstream reaches. Though more permeable, dams with spillway discharge has smaller populations of native species above these structures than below the dams or on undammed streams. Our data on adult and larval distributions, combined with the absence of first-stage shrimp larvae, indicate that amphidromy is obligate for most of the native fauna. Disturbance regime appeared to be a poor predictor of successful invasion by exotics in this system, whereas exotic abundance was consistently inversely related to abundance and species richness of native fauna across all sampling categories.

Richness and cover of non-native species were highest at the edges of the remnant and declined to relatively uniform levels within the remnant. Native species richness and cover were lowest at the edge adjoining a roadside but then showed little relation to distance from edge. Roadside edge quadrats were floristically distinct from most other quadrats when ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Soil phosphorus was significantly higher at the roadside edge but did not vary within the remnant itself. All other abiotic factors measured (NH4, NO3, S, pH and % organic carbon) showed little variation across the remnant. Non-native species richness and cover were strongly correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Native species were negatively correlated with soil phosphorus levels. Canonical Correspondence Analysis identified the perennial non-native grasses of high biomass as species most dependent on high soil nutrient levels. Such species may be resource-limited in undisturbed soils. Three classes of non-native plants have invaded this species-rich grassland. (1) generalist species (greater than or equal to 50 % frequency), mostly therophytes with non-specialized habitat or germination requirements; (2) resource-limited species comprising perennial species of high biomass that are dependent on nutrient increases and/or soil disturbances before they can invade the community and; (3) species of intermediate frequency (1-30 %), of low to high biomass potential, that appear to have non-specialized habitat requirements but are currently limited by seed dispersal, seedling establishment or the current site management. Native species richness and cover are most negatively affected by increases in non-native cover. Declines are largely evident once the non-native cover exceeds 40 %. Widespread, generalist non-native species are numerous in intact sites and will have to be considered a permanent part of the flora of remnant grasslands.

Ten per cent of species proved sensitive to grazing intensity categories (derived largely from land tenure) in hill woodland compared to 3% of species in grassland or poplar box woodland. There were no clear trends in the relative response of native and exotic species, although overall, species richness was greatest in either the moderate or heavily grazed treatment for all broad vegetation types. It is suggested that the interaction between Themeda dominance and the inter-tussock flora may contribute to the importance of grazing as a determinant of floristic composition in hill woodland broad vegetation type. Mechanical disturbance is implicated as a means of effecting the spread of exotic plants. However, there are relatively few exotic species that appear to have the capacity to displace native species without mechanical disturbance, although a notable exception is Phyla canescens in the flood-prone habitat. Moderate domestic stock grazing is compatible with nature conservation on the Darling Downs, although it is demonstrated that a proportion of the flora is sensitive to grazing. Remnants will need to be managed under a range of grazing regimes, including light total grazing pressure that excludes domestic stock to ensure the survival of the full range of species.

The vegetation of the zone nearest to the road showed weaker correlation with altitude and stronger correlation with continentality, a marked increase in short-lived exotic species, and a greater proportion of the more continental and weedy vegetation types than the vegetation of the outermost verge. This supports the hypothesis of anthropogenic continentality of road-shoulders. The most frequent species on the road-shoulders are those exotic species that transgress climatic barriers in their native continents. This suggests that, globally, the range of such species is liable to expand, particularly in the habitat-complex provided by roadsides.",Web of Science,Many,New Zealand,South Island,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Disturbance,Broad Tolerances,primary

However, the ecological processes controlling the spread of hybrid genotypes have rarely been studied in the field. We compared fruit characteristics, fruit preference, and seed dispersal by native frugivores among the non-indigenous succulent Carpobrotus edulis, the putative native congener C. chilensis, and the hybrids resulting from introgressive hybridization. In this system, the non-native C. edulis and hybrids are known to be very successful invaders of California coastal plant communities. Carpobrotus edulis and hybrids produced more fruits per clone than C. chilensis, primarily as a consequence of larger clone size. Clone size and energy content of fruits were good predictors of fruit removal. Marked fruits of C. edulis and hybrids were removed faster than those of the other morphotypes, and C. edulis fruits were preferred over those of C. chilensis in a fruit transplant experiment. However, total fruit removal by the end of the growing season was very high for all morphotypes. Seats from black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the most common frugivores in our sites, contained more seeds from C. edulis and hybrid morphotypes than from C. chilensis, and more than would be expected based on relative fruit abundance. Germination of seeds from C. edulis and hybrids was enhanced after gut passage, whereas germination of C. chilensis decreased after gut passage, compared to seed germination from intact fruits. The results suggest that patterns of fruit preference by native frugivores and seed survival after gut passage facilitate the successful spread of an aggressive introduced species and hybrids in contrast to the less aggressive, apparently native congener.",Web of Science,Carpobrotus spp. (Aizoaceae),United States,California,Bodega Bay Marine Reserve,38.19,-123.4,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Hybridization,Effective Disperser,primary

The model simulates factors which have been invoked as major determinants of invasive success: plant traits, environmental features and disturbance level. Results show that interactions between these determinants of invasive success are at least as important as the main effects. The complexity of invasions has promoted the belief that many factors must be invoked to explain invasions. This study shows that by incorporating interactions and mechanisms into our models we can potentially reduce the number of factors needed to predict plant invasions. The importance of interactions, however, means that predictions about invasions must be context-specific. The search for all-encompassing rules for invasions is therefore futile.

At several salt marshes and restoration sites around Humboldt Bay, distribution of this plant has increased significantly. We investigated the relative contributions of vegetative tiller production and seed germination to the establishment and expansion of S. densiflora. Lateral spread of plants surrounded by competitors were compared to areas without competing plant species. Plants growing in areas without competitors had significantly higher rates of vegetative expansion (p < 0.0001). Viable seed production, germination rates, seedling survivorship, and growth of adult plants were measured in six salinity treatments. Approximately 1,977 +/- 80 viable seeds are produced per plant (0.25-0.5 m(2)). The number of germinating seeds was inversely related to increases in salinity. Salinity treatments between 19 parts per thousand and 35 parts per thousand produced significantly lower germination rates than salinities of 0-18 parts per thousand (p < 0.0001). Seedling survivorship was 50% at less than or equal to 4 parts per thousand and 8-14% at greater than or equal to 11 parts per thousand. Lateral expansion of adult, greenhouse-grown plants occurred in all salinity treatments, with modest decreases in the highest salinity treatments (p < 0.05).

Scop. (Californian, Canada, or creeping thistle) is an exotic perennial herb indigenous to Eurasia that successfully established in New Zealand (NZ) approximately 130 years ago. Presently, C. arvense is considered one of the worst invasive weeds in NZ arable and pastoral productions systems. A mechanism commonly invoked to explain the apparent increased vigour of introduced weeds is release from natural enemies. The enemy-release hypothesis (ERH) predicts that plants in an introduced range should experience reduced herbivory, particularly from specialists, and that release from this natural enemy pressure facilitates increased plant performance in the introduced range. In 2007, surveys were carried out in 13 populations in NZ (7 in the North Island and 6 in the South Island) and in 12 populations in central Europe to quantify and compare growth characteristics of C. arvense in its native versus introduced range. Altitude and mean annual precipitation for each population were used as covariates in an attempt to explain differences or similarities in plant traits among ranges. All plant traits varied significantly among populations within a range. Shoot dry weight was greater in the South Island compared to Europe, which is in line with the prediction of increased plant performance in the introduced range; however, this was explained by environmental conditions. Contrary to expectations, the North Island was not different from Europe for all plant traits measured, and after adjustment for covariates showed decreased shoot density and dry weight compared to the native range. Therefore, environmental factors appear to be more favourable for growth of C. arvense in both the North and South Islands. In accordance with the ERH, there was significantly greater endophagous herbivory in the capitula and stems of shoots in Europe compared to both NZ ranges. In NZ, capitulum attack from Rhinocyllus conicus was found only in the North Island, and no stem-mining attack was found anywhere in NZ. Thus, although C. arvense experiences significantly reduced natural enemy pressure in both the North and South Islands of NZ there is no evidence that it benefits from this enemy release.",Web of Science,Cirsium arvense (L.)

This species was introduced first as an ornamental plant then it was massively planted by foresters in many countries but its origins and the process of invasion remain poorly documented.

Genetic variability and structure of 23 populations from the invasive range and 22 populations from the native range were analysed using eight nuclear microsatellite loci and five chloroplast DNA regions. Chloroplast DNA diversity suggests there were multiple introductions from a single geographic region (the north-eastern United States). A low reduction of genetic diversity was observed in the invasive range for both nuclear and plastid genomes. High propagule pressure including both the size and number of introductions shaped the genetic structure in Europe and boosted genetic diversity. Populations from Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany showed high genetic diversity and low differentiation among populations, supporting the hypothesis that numerous introduction events, including multiple individuals and exchanges between sites, have taken place during two centuries of plantation.

However, if losing natural enemies leads to unregulated population growth, this implies that native species are themselves normally subject to natural enemy regulation. One possible widespread mechanism of natural enemy regulation is negative soil feedbacks, in which resident species growing on home soils are disadvantaged because of a build-up of species-specific soil pathogens. Here we construct simple models in which pathogens cause resident species to suffer reduced competitive ability on home soils and consider the consequences of such pathogen regulation for potential invading species. We show that the probability of successful invasion and its timescale depend strongly on the competitive ability of the invader on resident soils, but are unaffected by whether or not the invader also suffers reduced competitive ability on home soils (i.e. pathogen regulation). This is because, at the start of an invasion, the invader is rare and hence mostly encounters resident soils. However, the lack of pathogen regulation does allow the invader to achieve an unusually high population density. We also show that increasing resident species diversity in a pathogen-regulated community increases invasion resistance by reducing the frequency of home-site encounters. Diverse communities are more resistant to invasion than monocultures of the component species: they preclude a greater range of potential invaders, slow the timescale of invasion and reduce invader population size. Thus, widespread pathogen regulation of resident species is a potential explanation for the empirical observation that diverse communities are more invasion resistant.",Web of Science,,,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release;Community Species Richness,,primary

Our feeding trials involved three species of generalist herbivore (beet armyworm, cabbage looper and the garden snail) in two types of laboratory feeding trial (single plant species and preference tests). All traits were significantly related to the amount of leaf area consumed, with foliar nitrogen followed by leaf strength explaining most of the variation in herbivore damage.

Allelopathy has been suggested as a potential mechanism for this success because invasive plants frequently establish monocultures and may produce allelochemicals evolutionarily novel to the recipient community. However, species are typically tested in isolation making the relative strength of allelopathy difficult to assess. We conducted laboratory bioassays for 10 co-occurring non-native species to determine the relative strength of their allelopathic potential. These species represented a suite of successful invaders within a young forest and were from a variety of plant life forms: trees, lianas, shrubs, and herbs. We determined the germination responses of a target species to a gradient of leaf extract concentrations to assess relative allelopathic potential. The relative strength of germination inhibition was quantified by the slope (beta) of the germination response to plant extract concentration. Ailanthus altissima extract had the greatest inhibitory effect on target species germination out of all 10 species (beta = -0.55) while the other tree species, Acer platanoides extract, had small effects on germination (beta = -0.14). For lianas, Celastrus orbiculatus extract inhibited the target species (beta = -0.28) more than Lonicera japonica extract (beta = -0.06).

We tested two hypotheses for exotic plant success: escape from specialist insect herbivores and a greater response to disturbance in the introduced range. Within three introduced populations in Montana, USA, and three native populations in Germany, we experimentally manipulated insect herbivore pressure and created small-scale disturbances to determine how these factors affect the performance of houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale), a widespread exotic in western North America.

Small-scale experimental disturbances enhanced seedling recruitment in both ranges, but subsequent seedling survival was more positively affected by disturbance in the introduced range. We combined these experimental results with demographic data from each population to parameterize integral projection population models to assess how enemy escape and disturbance might differentially influence C. officinale in each range. Model results suggest that escape from specialist insects would lead to only slight increases in the growth rate (lambda) of introduced populations. In contrast, the larger response to disturbance in the introduced vs. native range had much greater positive effects on lambda. These results together suggest that, at least in the regions where the experiments were performed, the differences in response to small disturbances by C. officinale contribute more to higher abundance in the introduced range compared to at home. Despite the challenges of conducting experiments on a wide biogeographic scale and the logistical constraints of adequately sampling populations within a range, this approach is a critical step forward to understanding the success of exotic plants.",Web of Science,Cynoglossum officinale,United States; Germany,Montana,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release;Disturbance,,primary

Two parasite species, Lernaea cyprinacea and Ligula intestinalis, are probably introduced. Both were found on or in a range of native fish species, where they may cause severe disease. Levels of parasitism and parasite diversity were significantly greater in native fishes than in exotic species, and this may contribute to an enhanced demographic performance and competitive ability in invading exotics. Levels of parasitism and parasite diversity in native fishes were negatively related to habitat disturbance, in particular to a suite of factors that indicate increased human use of the river and surrounding environment.

The abundance of glossy buckthorn was estimated in five patch cuts and three single-tree cuts in a 90 year old eastern hemlock-eastern white pine-sweet birch forest at the Woodman Horticultural Farm in Durham, NH, USA. Glossy buckthorn was 96 times more abundant in logged areas than in uncut control plots.

However, the greater proportion of individuals > 2 m tall and greater reproductive vigor of glossy buckthorn in large gaps relative to small gaps-despite fewer years available for growth-suggest that larger disturbances lead to more resources available for buckthorn growth, survival, and reproduction.

Although Carpobrotus edulis is a clonal plant, there is no information on the role of clonality for the invasion by this species, therefore the objective of this study was to test whether or not physiological integration improves the performance of C. edulis invading coastal sand dunes. To do that, a 6-month field experiment was designed in which the stolon connections between the apical ramets and the C. edulis mats were severed to prevent physiological integration. This treatment was applied to ramets growing under high and low competition with the native species. Apical ramets with intact stolon connections were used as control. Integration improved the survivorship and growth of apical ramets, both in high and low competition. Connected ramets showed a more pronounced increase of clonal growth (estimated as stolon length) during the experimental period and a higher total biomass and number of ramets at the completion of the experiment. In terms of survivorship, the benefit of integration was greater under high competition.

Similar analyses revealed clonal structure in R. multiflora populations both park and pasture habitats but with significantly greater genetic diversity and sexual inputs in the former than the latter. These results are consistent with a model of invasive spread involving clonal spread, sexual reproduction, and bird-mediated seed dispersal into established patches.

We then use an ensemble of 12 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to project changes in climatic habitat for the three invasive species by 2100. The combined methodologies, predictors, and models produce a robust assessment of invasion risk inclusive of many of the approaches typically used individually to assess climate change impacts. Current invasion risk is widespread in southeastern states for all three species, although cogongrass invasion risk is more restricted to the Gulf Coast. Climate change is likely to enable all three species to greatly expand their ranges. Risk from privet and kudzu expands north into Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England states by 2100.

Understanding mechanisms of plant invasions are difficult to elucidate from observations, yet are crucial for ecological management of invasions. Hieracium lepidulum, an asteraceous invader in New Zealand, is a species for which several explanatory mechanisms can be raised. Alternative mechanisms, including competitive dominance, disturbance of resident vegetation allowing competitive release or nutrient resource limitation reducing competition with the invader are raised to explain invasion. We tested these hypotheses in two field experiments which manipulated competitive, disturbance and nutrient environments in pre-invasion and post-invasion vegetation. H. lepidulum and resident responses to environmental treatments were measured to allow interpretation of underlying mechanisms of establishment and persistence. We found that H. lepidulum differed in functional response profile from native species. We also found that other exotic invaders at the sites were functionally different to H. lepidulum in their responses. These data support the hypothesis that different invaders use different invasion mechanisms from one another. These data also suggest that functional differentiation between invaders and native resident vegetation may be an important contributing factor allowing invasion. H. lepidulum appeared to have little direct competitive effect on post-invasion vegetation, suggesting that competition was not a dominant mechanism maintaining its persistence. There was weak support for disturbance allowing initial establishment of H. lepidulum in pre-invasion vegetation, but disturbance did not lead to invader dominance. Strong support for nutrient limitation of resident species was provided by the rapid competitive responses with added nutrients despite presence of H. lepidulum. Rapid competitive suppression of H. lepidulum once nutrient limitation was alleviated suggests that nutrient limitation may be an important process allowing the invader to dominate. Possible roles of historical site degradation and/or invader-induced soil chemical/microbial changes in nutrient availability are discussed.",Web of Science,Hieracium lepidulum,New Zealand,,,-44.26,168.39,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Disturbance,Superior Competitor,primary

The main factor explaining the observed patterns of genetic diversity is the history of introductions, with each introduced population acting as a source for colonization of nearby rivers.

However, whether specialized pollination requirements pose a significant barrier to plant invasions is not yet clear. Likewise, the contribution of pollinators to the fecundity of facultatively self-pollinating invasive plant species is poorly understood. We addressed these issues using the self-compatible and autonomously self-pollinating Lilium formosanum, which also has large, showy flowers that are adapted for pollination by hawk moths. We investigated the pollination of this lily-which is indigenous to Taiwan-in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where it is invasive. The long-tongued hawk moth Agrius convolvuli was identified as the primary pollinator on the basis of field observations, pollen load analysis, presence of lepidopteran scales on stigmas, and higher seed production in emasculated flowers exposed at night than in those exposed during the day. Remarkably, this moth is native to much of the Old World, including Taiwan and South Africa. Autonomous self-pollination resulted in seed production, but at a reduced level relative to the seed production of open-and hand-pollinated flowers, which was significant in one out of two populations examined. Thus, pollinators potentially contribute to invasion by increasing seed production and genetic variability through cross-pollination, although contributions of pollinators to seed set versus that of autonomous self-pollination may vary between populations. We conclude that specialized pollination requirements do not present a barrier to invasions when plants are specialized to pollinators or pollinator functional groups with very wide distributions.",Web of Science,Lilium formosanum,South Africa,,KwaZulu-Natal,-30,30.5,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

The aim of the study was to predict the responses of these 24 non-native fishes to the warming temperatures of England and Wales predicted under climate change in 2050. 3. The predictive use of climate-matching models and an air and water temperature regression model suggested that there are six non-native fishes currently persistent but not established in England and Wales whose establishment and subsequent invasion would benefit substantially from the predicted warming temperatures. These included the common carp Cyprinus carpio and European catfish Silurus glanis, fishes that also exert a relatively high propagule pressure through stocking to support angling and whose spatial distribution is currently increasing significantly, including in open systems. 4.

The ecological consequences of C. carpio invasion were assessed as potentially severe in England and Wales, with impacts likely to relate to habitat destruction, macrophyte loss and increased water turbidity.

In this study we estimated secondary production and diet of four populations of Pomacea canaliculata, a freshwater invasive snail, in wetlands (abandoned paddy, oxbow pond, drainage channel, and river meander) in monsoonal Hong Kong (lat. 22A degrees N). Apple snail secondary production (ash-free dry mass [AFDM]) ranged from 165.9 to 233.3 g m(-2) year(-1), and varied between seasons. Production was lower during the cool dry northeast monsoon, when water temperatures might have limited growth, but fast growth and recruitment of multiple cohorts were possible throughout much (7-10 months) of the year and especially during the warm, wet southwest monsoon. The diet, as revealed by stomach-content analysis, consisted mainly of detritus and macrophytes, and was broadly consistent among habitats despite considerable variation in the composition and cover of aquatic plants. Apple snail annual production was > 10 times greater than production estimates for other benthic macroinvertebrates in Hong Kong (range 0.004-15 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1), n = 29). Furthermore, annual production estimates for three apple snail populations (i.e. > 230 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1)) were greater than published estimates for any other freshwater snails (range 0.002-194 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1), n = 33), regardless of climatic regime or habitat type. High production by P. canaliculata in Hong Kong was attributable to the topical climate (annual mean similar to 24A degrees C), permitting rapid growth and repeated reproduction, together with dietary flexibility including an ability to consume a range of macrophytes. If invasive P. canaliculata can monopolize food resources, its high productivity indicates potential for competition with other macroinvertebrate primary consumers.

However, the physiological mechanisms by which invasive plants increase at the expense of existing native plants are poorly understood. Plant growth is always related to energy-use process including energy assimilation and expenditure, and thus examination of energetic properties could provide mechanistic insight into growth responses to increased CO2. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of rising CO2 on the growth and energetic properties of alien invasive species (Wedelia trilobata (L.) Hitchc.) and its native congener (Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck.) Merr.) in South China, and to determine if the specific energetic properties of invasive species at elevated CO2 favoring its growth. Elevated CO2 stimulated a greater increase in biomass production for invasive W. trilobata (58.9%) than for its indigenous congener (48.1%). Meanwhile, elevated CO2 altered the energetic properties differently upon species. For invasive W. trilobata, elevated CO2 significantly increased total energetic gain via photosynthetic activity (A (total)), but decreased energetic cost of biomass construction (CC), and thus enhanced photosynthetic energy-use efficiency (PEUE) by 85.3%. In contrast, the indigenous W. chinensis showed a slight increase in PEUE by 43.8%. Additionally, W. trilobata individuals grown in elevated CO2 increased energy allocation towards stems. Statistic analysis revealed significant associations between growth characteristics (relative growth rate and biomass) and energetic properties (CC and PEUE), suggesting the greater growth stimulation in invasive species could be partly explained by its specific energetic properties in elevated CO2 concentration. The invasive species showed a greater increase in energy-use efficiency under elevated CO2, which consequently facilitated its growth. It might be a physiological mechanism promoting success of invasion with ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration.",Web of Science,Wedelia trilobata,China,,Guangzhou,,,Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Climate Change,,primary

Although resource availability, often related to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, appears central to the invasibility of biological communities, understanding the links between resources, diversity and invasibility is often confounded by the covariance among key variables. To test the hypothesis that community invasibility remains contingent on the type and intensity of disturbance and their impacts on plant community diversity and resource availability, we designed an experiment testing the invasibility of northern fescue prairies by smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.), a Eurasian perennial grass, threatening the structure and function of prairie remnants throughout the Great Plains. Using soil disturbances and herbicide, we imposed treatments manipulating the diversity and resource availability of native prairies. Our observations demonstrate that the vulnerability of native prairies to exotic plant invasions remains contingent on resources. While the establishment of smooth brome seedlings increased with increasing disturbance, its impact depended on the availability of soil nitrogen. As a result, soil burial treatments, simulating disturbance by northern pocket gophers, provided poor recruitment areas for smooth brome, and their low levels of soil moisture and nitrogen, combined with the rapid recovery of the prairie community, compromised seedling establishment. Emphasizing the covariance of diversity and key environmental variables following disturbance, our findings illustrate the importance of disturbance type and intensity on community invasibility.

Using the relationship between height and age to reconstruct the rate of increase of the population, we identified three distinct invasion phases. We hypothesised that these related to the abundance of woody vegetation and therefore of non-native blackbirds (Turdus merula), the primary disperser of hawthorn in this environment. From the 1930s to 1959, increase was relatively slow, with hawthorn spread probably constrained due to browsing of seedlings by European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the low abundance of a native N-fixing shrub (matagouri, Discaria toumatou) providing few perches and nesting sites for blackbirds and safe sites for hawthorn establishment. Subsequently, from 1959 to 1976, hawthorn showed greater than six fold acceleration in its rate of population increase, resulting largely from intensive rabbit control, less frequent fires, and aerial topdressing of phosphate fertilizer promoting the growth of matagouri scrub. In addition, maturing hawthorn trees provided additional food and nesting sites for blackbirds. Hawthorn population increase slowed again from 1976, possibly because most suitable habitat in the immediate vicinity of the population neared saturation. From this case study we have constructed a general hypothesis for the factors determining the rate of invasion of matagouri-grassland habitats by bird-dispersed non-native woody plants in montane New Zealand.",Web of Science,Crataegus monogyna,New Zealand,,South Island,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland;Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

Reproductive and establishment traits are considered key features of a population expansion process, but few works have studied many of these simultaneously. This work examines how large the differences are in reproductive and establishment traits between two Fabaceae, the exotic invasive, Gleditsia triacanthos and the native, Acacia aroma. Gleditsia is a serious leguminous woody invader in various parts of the world and Acacia is a common native tree of Argentina. Both species have similar dispersal mechanisms and their reproductive phenology overlaps. We chose 17 plants of each species in a continuous forest of the Chaco Serrano Forest of Cordoba, Argentina. In each plant we measured fruit production, fruit removal (exclusion experiments), seed predation (pre- and post-dispersal), seed germination, seed bank (on each focal tree, three sampling periods during the year), and density of seedlings (around focal individuals and randomly in the study site). Gleditsia presented some traits that could favour the invasion process, such as a higher number of seeds per plant, percentage of scarified seed germination and density of seedlings around the focal individuals, than Acacia. On the other hand, Gleditsia presented a higher percentage of seed predation. The seed bank was persistent in both species and no differences were observed in fruit removal. This work highlights the importance of simultaneously studying reproductive and establishment variables involved in the spreading of an exotic invasive species. It also gives important insight into the variables to be considered when planning management strategies. The results are discussed from the perspective of some remarkable hypotheses on invasive species and may contribute to rethinking some aspects of the theory on invasive species.

In the last twenty years the spread of fountain grass in the Canary Islands has been very rapid. We compared its ecophysiological, architectural and reproductive traits with those of three native grasses (Hyparrhenia hirta, Cenchrus ciliaris and Aristida adscensionis) in two habitats of Tenerife Island which differ in rainfall. The detection of traits that differ between native and invader grasses may provide information for the improved control and eradication of the latter contributing to protect the native plant diversity. P. setaceum and the native grasses differed in all measured traits and in their response to water availability which is more restricted in the southern site. Specific leaf area was lower in P. setaceum than in the native grasses. Although this reduces carbon assimilation per unit area, it also reduces transpiration, increasing water use efficiency and contributes to the maintenance of high relative water content. Leaf N in P. setaceum was lower than in the native grasses indicating higher nitrogen use efficiency. The activity of photosystem II was higher and lasted longer in P. setaceum than in the native grasses. The ecophysiological traits of P. setaceum support its large size, extensive canopy and shorter leaf senescence period. They confer considerable competitive advantage to the invader and partially explain its success in the Canary Islands. The differences between the invader and the native grasses were maintained in both sites revealing a good adaptation of P. setaceum to the low resource local habitats in the Canary Islands and confirms its large plasticity. The large invasive potential of P. setaceum, in concert with the projected global changes, forecast eventual risks for the conservation of the endemic flora and remaining native communities in the Canary Islands.

However, few studies have examined release from herbivory as a mechanism of invasion in oceanic island systems, which have experienced particularly high loss of native species due to the invasion of non-native animal and plant species. We surveyed putative defensive traits and leaf damage rates in 19 pairs of taxonomically related invasive and native species in Hawaii, representing a broad taxonomic diversity. Leaf damage by insects and pathogens was monitored in both wet and dry seasons. We found that native species had higher leaf damage rates than invasive species, but only during the dry season. However, damage rates across native and invasive species averaged only 2% of leaf area. Native species generally displayed high levels of structural defense (leaf toughness and leaf thickness, but not leaf trichome density) while native and invasive species displayed similar levels of chemical defenses (total phenolics). A defense index, which integrated all putative defense traits, was significantly higher for native species, suggesting that native species may allocate fewer resources to growth and reproduction than do invasive species. Thus, our data support the idea that invasive species allocate fewer resources to defense traits, allowing them to outperform native species through increased growth and reproduction. While strong impacts of herbivores on invasion are not supported by the low damage rates we observed on mature plants, population-level studies that monitor how herbivores influence recruitment, mortality, and competitive outcomes are needed to accurately address how herbivores influence invasion in Hawaii.",Web of Science,Many,United States,Hawaii,Hawaii,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

Here, we tested whether these enemies have significant impacts on the performance of this plant in its native range. We excluded enemies from the three principal life-history stages (seed, seedling, and adult) of this annual in a series of field experiments; at the adult stage, we also manipulated soil disturbance and conspecific density. We then measured the consequences of these treatments for growth, survival, and reproduction. Excluding fungi and vertebrate granivores from seeds on the soil surface did not increase germination relative to control plots. Seedling survivorship was only slightly increased by the exclusion of molluscs and other herbivores. Insecticide reduced damage to leaves of adult plants, but did not improve growth or reproduction. Growth and survivorship of adults were strongly increased by disturbance, while higher conspecific density reduced performance in disturbed plots. These results indicate ragweed is insensitive to attack by many of its natural enemies, helping to explain its native-range success. In addition, they suggest that even though ragweed lost most of its insect folivores while invading Europe, escape from these enemies is unlikely to have provided a significant demographic advantage; instead, disturbance is likely to have been a much more important factor in its invasion. Escape from enemies should not be assumed to explain the success of exotic species unless improved performance also can be demonstrated; native-range studies can help achieve this goal.",Web of Science,Ambrosia artemisiifolia,Canada,Toronto,Koffler Scientific Reserve,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

Using experimental monocultures of 11 old-field perennial plant species differing in maximum size, as well as mixtures composed of all monoculture species, we tested our primary hypothesis that monocultures of larger species will be more susceptible to natural invasion. After 3 years, monocultures of larger species were invaded by a significantly greater number of species, and more ramets, from the surrounding vegetation. Invading plant species were significantly smaller than the monoculture species being invaded, suggesting that smaller plant species may be better invaders. Thus, we quantified a trade-off between species size, which is frequently associated with increased competitive ability for light, and invasibility, suggesting one reason why large and small species coexist in virtually all plant communities. Although we expected that invasion would enhance biomass production by more fully capturing available resources, we found that the most highly invaded plots of each species produced significantly less biomass. This suggests that increased diversity resulting from invasion did not result in complementary resource use. Mixture plots containing all experimental species did not admit a significantly different number of invading ramets or species than most monocultures, indicating no obvious role for diversity in resistance to invasion, or complementary resource use.

Invasive annual grasses are particularly responsive to increases in N and water availabilities, which may result in competition with native forb communities. Additionally, conditions favoring increased invasive grass production in arid and semi-arid regions can increase fire risk, negatively impacting woody vegetation that is not adapted to fire. We conducted a seeded garden experiment and a 5-year field fertilization experiment to investigate how winter annual production is altered by increasing N supply under a range of water availabilities. The greatest production of invasive grasses and native forbs in the garden experiment occurred under the highest soil N (inorganic N after fertilization = 2.99 g m(-2)) and highest watering regime, indicating these species are limited by both water and N. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis on the multi-year field fertilization study showed that winter annual biomass was primarily limited by November-December precipitation. Biomass exceeded the threshold capable of carrying fire when inorganic soil N availability was at least 3.2 g m(-2) in pion-juniper woodland. Due to water limitation in creosote bush scrub, biomass exceeded the fire threshold only under very wet conditions regardless of soil N status. The CART analyses also revealed that percent cover of invasive grasses and native forbs is primarily dependent on the timing and amount of precipitation and secondarily dependent on soil N and site-specific characteristics.

Here, we focused on the early phases of ornamental plant invasion in order to identify which plant features and cultivation practices may favor the escape of ornamental plants from domestic gardens to abandoned agricultural land sites in the Mediterranean Region. We used an original approach which consisted in visiting 120 private gardens in an urbanizing rural area of the French Mediterranean backcountry, and then visited surrounding old fields to determine which planted species had escaped out of the gardens. We built a database of 407 perennial ornamental alien species (most of which were animal-dispersed), and determined nineteen features that depicted the strength of species' propagule pressure within gardens, the match between species requirements and local physical environment, and each species' reproductive characteristics. Using standard and phylogenetic logistic regression, we found that ornamental alien plants were more likely to have escaped if they were planted in gardens' margins, if they had a preference for dry soil, were tolerant to high-pH or pH-indifferent, and if they showed a capacity for clonal growth. Focusing only on animal-dispersed plants, we found that alien plants were more likely to have escaped if they were abundant in gardens and showed preference for dry soil. This suggests that gardening practices have a primary impact on the probability of a species to escape from cultivation, along with species pre-adaptation to local soil conditions, and capacity of asexual reproduction.

Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community resistance to invasion.

Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and light regimes) are needed.

First, we exposed seven Microstegium populations to a drought treatment in growth chambers and monitored growth and physiological responses. Then, we established a greenhouse experiment using a subset of the populations; two that exhibited the most divergent responses and one intermediate population. In the greenhouse, we manipulated drought and shade and evaluated biomass production and specific leaf area (SLA). Microstegium exhibited plasticity for biomass production and SLA in the greenhouse experiment, and populations significantly varied in the degree of plasticity under drought and shade treatments. Two populations significantly increased biomass production under favorable conditions, unlike the third population. The most productive populations also responded to shade stress via greater SLA, possibly allowing for greater utilization of available light, while the third population did not. These results show that Microstegium can exhibit plastic responses to environmental conditions.

As predicted, invasion success increased with phylogenetic distance between the invading and the resident bacterial species in both the presence and the absence of protistan bacterivory. The frequency of successful invader establishment was best explained by average phylogenetic distance between the invader and all resident species, possibly indicating limitation by the availability of the unexploited niche (i.e., organic substances in the medium capable of supporting the invader growth); invader abundance was best explained by phylogenetic distance between the invader and its nearest resident relative, possibly indicating limitation by the availability of the unexploited optimal niche (i.e., the subset of organic substances supporting the best invader growth).

However, little experimental evidence demonstrates whether local species can successfully compete with exotics. We experimentally determined the existence of competition for food between the exotic wasp Vespula germanica, one of the most recent Patagonian invaders, and the native ant assemblage. Both wasps and ants are generalist predators and scavengers, sharing habitat and food resources. We selected 30 sites within scrubland habitats where both ants and wasps were present. At each site, we placed containers with protein baits under three treatments: wasp exclusion, ant exclusion, and control (i.e., free access for wasps and ants). Ant exclusion increased the number of wasps (with regard to a control), but wasp exclusion did not affect ant abundance. This result suggests that native ants affect the foraging activity of exotic wasps but not vice versa. Aggressive behaviors and worker aggregation may explain the competitive advantage of ants. Ants bite wasp legs and massively aggregate on food sources, physically limiting the landing of wasps on baits. If the outcome of interactions at baits reported here influence wasp population-level parameters, this competitive interaction could be one of the factors explaining the low abundance of this exotic wasp in NW Patagonia in comparison with other invaded regions.",Web of Science,Vespula germanica,Argentina,Patagonia,Nahuel Huapi National Park,-40.998298,-71.499023,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,omnivore

In fact, climate warming has been shown to potentially drive endangered species out of reserves. Less attention has been paid to the related problem that a warmer climate may also foster the invasion of alien species into reserve networks. Here, we use niche-based predictive modelling to assess to which extent the Austrian Natura 2000 network and a number of habitat types of conservation value outside this network might be prone to climate warming driven changes in invasion risk by Robinia pseudacacia L., one of the most problematic alien plants in Europe. Results suggest that the area potentially invaded by R. pseudacacia will increase considerably under a warmer climate. Interestingly, invasion risk will grow at a higher than average rate for most of the studied habitat types but less than the national average in Natura 2000 sites. This result points to a potential bias in legal protection towards high mountain areas which largely will remain too cold for R. pseudacacia. In contrast, the selected habitat types are more frequent in montane or lower lying regions, where R. pseudacacia invasion risk will increase most pronouncedly. We conclude that management plans of nature reserves should incorporate global warming driven changes in invasion risk in a more explicit manner. In case of R. pseudacacia, reducing propagule pressure by avoiding purposeful plantation in the neighbourhood of reserves and endangered habitats is a simple but crucial measure to prevent further invasion under a warmer climate.

Many species exhibit substantial fine-scaled spatial variation in phenology and interannual differences in phenological timing in response to environmental variation. Yet describing and understanding this variation is limited by the availability of appropriate spatial and temporal datasets. Remote sensing provides such datasets, but has primarily been used to monitor broad-scale phenological patterns at coarse resolutions, necessarily missing fine spatial detail and intraspecies variation. We used hyperspectral remote sensing to characterize the spatial and temporal phenological variation of the invasive species Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) at two sites in California's San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Considerable phenological variation was detected: L. latifolium was simultaneously present in vegetative, early flowering, peak flowering, fruiting, and senescent stages in late June; the relative dominance and distribution of these stages varied interannually. Environmental determinants of phenology were investigated with variables derived from the hyperspectral image data, from a high resolution LiDAR (light detection and ranging) digital elevation model (DEM), and from local precipitation and streamflow data. Lepidium latifolium phenology was found to track water availability, and may also be influenced by intraspecific competition and edaphic stress. Lepidium latifolium has a unique phenology (summer flowering) relative to the communities it invades, which may allow invasion of an empty niche. Furthermore, many habitats are invaded by L. latifolium, which occurs in locally appropriate phenologies under the different environmental conditions.

Several features of G. pubescens were found as indicators of invasiveness: (i) the genus Galenia was not represented in native flora, and the majority of the species of the family (Aizoaceae) were alien or invasive; (ii) the growth type of G. pubescens (dense prostrate mats) was not found among the native species; (iii) resprouting ability, growth rates and seed production were within the range of well-known invaders Such as Carpobrotus spp and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L; (iv) the overlapping in flowering periods (73-94%) with those of native flora and the effective shading (99%) of the G. pubescens mats were considerably high.

Loss of foundation species could increase resource availability to the benefit of exotic plants, and could thereby facilitate invasion. The success of exotic plant invasions in sagebrush steppe was hypothesized to benefit from increased available soil water following removal of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), a foundation species. We examined the effects of sagebrush removal, with and without the extra soil water made available by exclusion of sagebrush, on abundance of exotic and native plants in the shrub steppe of southern Idaho, USA. We compared plant responses in three treatments: undisturbed sagebrush steppe; sagebrush removed; and sagebrush removed plus plots covered with *rainout* shelters that blocked winter-spring recharge of soil water. The third treatment allowed us to examine effects of sagebrush removal alone, without the associated increase in deep-soil water that is expected to accompany removal of sagebrush. Overall, exotic herbs (the grass Bromus tectorum and four forbs) were 3-4 times more abundant in shrub-removal and 2 times more abundant in shrub-removal + rainout-shelter treatments than in the control treatment, where sagebrush was undisturbed. Conversely, native forbs were only about half as abundant in shrub removal compared to control plots.

We examined the effects of fire on the demography of the invasive shrub Brazilian pepper, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi., which is invading fire-prone slash pine savannas of southern Florida.

The structural and ontogenic characteristics of individuals in invading and non-invading populations in the native range of the species were compared to test the implication of developmental plasticity on invasiveness. The results show that the shrub has a modular architecture governed by strong developmental rules. Cornus sericea is made up of two levels of organization, each with its own intrinsic sequence of differentiation. These intrinsic mechanisms were used as a framework for comparison and it was found that, in response to the light environment, developmental plasticity was elevated, resulting in two architectural strategies. This developmental plasticity concerns the growth direction and the size of the modules, the speed of their time-course changes, their branching and flowering. Under an open canopy, C. sericea rapidly develops large vertical structures and abundant flowering. This strategy leads the plant to be invasive by excluding competitors and disseminating in the landscape. In the understorey, C. sericea slowly develops long horizontal structures which creep across the soil surface, while assimilating structures are poorly developed.

Vincetoxicum rossicum is an invasive, perennial vine colonizing natural and seminatural habitats primarily in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. More than half its seeds exhibit polyembryony, a relatively uncommon condition in which a single seed produces multiple seedlings. For evaluating the potential consequences of polyembryony on invasiveness, V. rossicum plants derived from seeds of three embryonic classes-singlets, doublets, and triplets (one, two, and three seedlings per seed, respectively)-were paired in all combinations intraspecifically and with the co-occurring native herbs Solidago canadensis and Asclepias syriaca in a greenhouse study. Vincetoxicum rossicum biomass was 25-55% greater and follicle production 55-100% greater under intraspecific competition compared with interspecific competition. However, within a competitive environment, follicle production varied little. Regardless of competitive environment, V. rossicum originating from seeds with a greater number of embryos typically performed no better than plants arising from seed with fewer embryos (singlets = doublets = triplets)-except intraspecifically where doublets outperformed singlets, and with S. canadensis where triplets outperformed singlets. Our findings suggest that overall performance and fitness of V. rossicum is higher in mono-cultures than in mixed stands and that its ability to invade new habitats may not be attributable to the production of polyembryonic seeds.",Web of Science,Vincetoxicum rossicum,United States,New York,,42.7,-76.6,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,High Reprod.

Over the last century, native Phragmites australis lineages have been almost completely replaced along the North American Atlantic coast by an aggressive lineage originating from Eurasia. Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate biological invasions is critical to better understand what makes an invasive species successful. 2. Our objective was to determine what makes the introduced lineage so successful in the study area by specifically investigating if morphological and ecophysiological differences exist between native and introduced genetic lineages of P. australis. We hypothesized a priori that due to phenotypic differences and differences in plant nitrogen (N) content between lineages, the introduced lineage would have a greater photosynthetic potential. 3. In situ ecophysiological and morphological data were collected for 2 years in a mid-Atlantic tidal marsh and in a glasshouse experiment. We measured photosynthetic parameters (A(max), water use efficiency, stomatal conductance) using infrared gas analysis, in conjunction with ecophysiological and morphological parameters [specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, chlorophyll content, N content]. 4. Introduced P. australis maintained 51% greater rates of photosynthesis and up to 100% greater rates of stomatal conductance which are magnified by its 38-83% greater photosynthetic canopy compared to the native type. The introduced lineage also had a significantly greater SLA and N content. Glasshouse-grown plants and naturally occurring populations demonstrated similar trends in ecophysiological characteristics, verifying the heritability of these differences. These ecophysiological differences, when combined with an extended growing season, provide the mechanism to explain the success of introduced P. australis in North America. 5. Our findings suggest the native type is a low-nutrient specialist, with a more efficient photosynthetic mechanisms and lower N demand, whereas the introduced type requires nearly four times more N than the native type to be an effective competitor. 6. Synthesis. Our study is the first to combine field and laboratory data to explain a biological invasion attributed to ecophysiological differences between genetic lineages.

Understanding mechanisms of invasion is a high priority, heightened by the management imperative of acting quickly after species introduction. While information about invading species' ecology is often unavailable, species distribution data can be collected near the onset of invasion. By examining distribution patterns of exotic and native plant species at multiple spatial scales, we aim to identify the scale (of those studied) that accounts for most variability in exotic species abundance, and infer likely drivers of invasion. Location River Murray wetlands, south-eastern Australia. Methods A nested, crossed survey design was used to determine the extent of variation in wetland plant abundance, grazing intensity and water depth at four spatial scales (reaches, wetland clumps, wetlands, wetland sections), and among three Depth-strata. We examined responses of exotic and native species groups (grouped into terrestrial and amphibious taxa), native weeds and 10 individual species using hierarchical ANOVA. Results As a group dominated by terrestrial taxa, exotic species cover varied at reach-, wetland- and section-scales. This likely reflects differences in abiotic characteristics and propagule pressure at these scales. Groups based on native species did not vary at any scale examined. Cover of 10 species mostly varied among and within wetlands (patterns unrelated to species' origin or functional group), but species' responses differed, despite individual plants being similar in size. While flora mostly varied among wetlands, exotic cover varied most among reaches (26%), which was attributed to hydrological modification and human activities. Main conclusions Multi-scale surveys can rapidly identify factors likely to affect species' distributions and can indicate where future research should be directed.

To test our hypothesis, we crossed rabbit exclosure treatments with disturbance treatments, and sampled the plant community in permanent plots over 3 years. We then estimated Markov chain model transition probabilities and found significant differences among treatments. As hypothesized, this modelling revealed that exotic plants survive better in disturbed areas, while natives prefer no rabbits or disturbance.

As expected from previous studies, projections based on the CGCM1 climate model were more extreme than those based on the HadCM3 model, and projections based on the a2 emissions scenario were more extreme than those based on the b2 emissions scenario. However, less expected were the highly nonlinear and contrasting projected changes in distributional areas among continents: increases in distributional potential in Europe often corresponded with decreases on other continents, and species seeing expanding potential on one continent often saw contracting potential on others. In conclusion, global climate change will have complex effects on invasive potential of plant species. The shifts and changes identified in this study suggest strongly that biological communities will see dramatic reorganizations in coming decades owing to shifting invasive potential by nonnative species.",Web of Science,Many,,,Europe,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Climate Change,,primary

However, in some respects, we lack a standard approach to compare the breadth of various studies and differentiate between alternative explanations. Furthermore, most of these hypotheses rely on 'changes in density' of an introduced species to infer invasiveness. Here, we propose a simple method to screen invasive plant species for potential differences in density effects between novel regions. Studies of plant competition using density series are a fundamental tool applied to virtually every aspect of plant population ecology to better understand evolution. Hence, we use a simple density series with substitution contrasting the performance of Centaurea solstitialis in monoculture (from one region) to mixtures (seeds from two regions). All else being equal, if there is no difference between the introduced species in the two novel regions compared, Argentina and California, then there should be no competitive differences between intra and inter-regional competition series. Using a replicated regression design, seeds of each species were sown in the greenhouse at 5 densities in monoculture and mixed and grown till onset of flowering. Centaurea seeds from California had higher germination while seedlings had significantly greater survival than Argentina. There was no evidence for density dependence in any measure for the California region but negative density dependence was detected in the germination of seeds from Argentina. The relative differences in competition also differed between regions with no evidence of differential competitive effects of seeds from Argentina in mixture versus monoculture while seeds from California expressed a relative cost in germination and relative growth rate in mixtures with Argentina. In the former instance, lack of difference does not mean 'no ecological differences' but does suggest that local adaptation in competitive abilities has not occurred. Importantly, this method successfully detected differences in the response of an invasive species to changes in density between novel regions which suggests that it is a useful preliminary means to explore invasiveness.",Web of Science,Centaurea solstitialis,Canada,Ontario,York University,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

Testing for stoichiometric constraints among invasive species is a novel challenge in invasion ecology to unravel how a successful invader tackles ecological barriers in novel ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the C:P and N:P ratios and the condition factor of a successful invader in lakes, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), collected from two Swedish lakes. Concurrently, we analyzed the elemental composition of the food (seston) and tissue of the mussels in which nutrient composition of food and mussels varied over time. Zebra mussel condition factor was weakly related to the their own tissue N:P and C:P ratios, although the relation with the later ratio was not significant. Smaller mussels had relatively lower tissue N:P ratio and higher condition factor. There was no difference in C:P and N:P ratios between seston and mussels' tissues. Our results indicated that the variation in nutrient stoichiometry of zebra mussels can be explained by food quality and quantity. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that fitness of invasive zebra mussels is not constrained by nutrient stoichiometry which is likely to be important for their proliferation in novel ecosystems. The lack of imbalance in C:P and N:P ratios between seston and mussels along with high tissue C:P ratio of the mussel allow them to tolerate potential P limitation and maintain high growth rate. Moreover, zebra mussels are able to change their tissue C:P and N:P ratios in response to the variation in elemental composition of their food. This can also help them to bypass potential nutrient stoichiometric constraints. Our finding is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms contributing to the success of exotic species from stoichiometric principles.",Web of Science,Dreissena polymorpha,Sweden,,,,,Field - Observational,lentic,Benthic,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances,filter

We investigated cattail abundance, litter accumulation, and species density in three bayside wetlands hydrologically connected and three protected wetlands hydrologically isolated from Lake Ontario. Mean litter biomass was higher in bayside wetlands (1.7-2.6 vs. 0.4-1.2 kg/m(2)) and negatively related to species density (p = 0.004) in both settings. A litter addition experiment demonstrated that fallen litter negatively influenced seedling survival (p = 0.061) and species density (p = 0.024). Decomposition rates accounted only partially for higher overall litter accumulation in bayside wetlands. Growing season water levels in bayside wetlands tracked Lake Ontario levels and showed less variation than protected wetlands.

Well-adapted native species are often considered superior competitors under stressful conditions. Here we investigate the competitive ability of the resource demanding alien Acacia longifolia, which invades nutrient-poor Mediterranean sand dunes such as in coastal areas of Portugal. We explore the hypothesis that drought may limit invasion in a factorial competition experiment of the alien invasive versus two native species of different functional groups (Halimium halimifolium, Pinus pinea), under well-watered and drought conditions. Changes in biomass, allocation pattern, and N-uptake-efficiency (via N-15-labeling) indicated a marked drought sensitivity of the invader. However, highly efficient drought adaptations of the native species did not provide a competitive advantage under water limiting conditions. The competitive strength of H. halimifolium towards the alien invader under well-watered conditions turned into a positive interaction between both species under drought. Further, low resource utilization by native species benefited A. longifolia by permitting continued high nitrogen uptake under drought. Hence, the N-fixing invader expresses low plasticity by continuous high resource utilization, even under low resource conditions. The introduction of novel traits into a community like N-fixation and high resource use may promote A. longifolia invasiveness through changes in the physical environment, i.e., the water and nutrient cycle of the invaded sand dune system, thereby potentially disrupting the co-evolved interactions within the native plant community.",Web of Science,Acacia longifolia,Portugal,,University of Bielefeld,52.037709,8.494835,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Fluctuating Resources,Superior Competitor,primary

However, whether rapid adaptation of introduced species can be driven by punctual changes in genome organization has received little attention. In plants, variation in genome size, i.e. variation in the amount of DNA per monoploid set of chromosomes through loss or gain of repeated DNA sequences, is known to influence a number of physiological, phenological and life-history features. The present study investigated whether change in genome size has contributed to the evolution of greater potential of vegetative growth in invasive populations of an introduced grass. The study was based on the recent demonstration that invasive genotypes of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) occurring in North America have emerged from recombination between introduced European strains. The genome sizes of more than 200 invasive and native genotypes were measured and their genome size was related to their phenotypic traits measured in a common glasshouse environment. Population genetics data were used to infer phylogeographical relationships between study populations, and the evolutionary history of genome size within the study species was inferred. Invasive genotypes had a smaller genome than European native genotypes from which they are derived. This smaller genome size had phenotypic effects that increased the species' invasive potential, including a higher early growth rate, due to a negative relationship between genome size and rate of stem elongation. Based on inferred phylogeographical relationships of invasive and native populations, evolutionary models were consistent with a scenario of genome reduction by natural selection during the invasion process, rather than a scenario of stochastic change. Punctual reduction in genome size could cause rapid changes in key phenotypic traits that enhance invasive ability. Although the generality of genome size variation leading to phenotypic evolution and the specific genomic mechanisms involved are not known, change in genome size may constitute an important but previously under-appreciated mechanism of rapid evolutionary change that may promote evolutionary novelties over short time scales.",Web of Science,Phalaris arundinacea,United States,Vermont; North Carolina,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General;Inherent Superiority,Rapid Growth,primary

According to the 'try-harder' hypothesis, successful aliens should differ from resident species with traits that allow them to deal better with the local conditions than resident species. On the other hand, the 'join-the-locals' hypothesis stresses the importance of filtering by environmental factors and predicts strong functional trait similarities between alien and native species, especially among the dominants. 2 On the basis of a functional trait comparison between native and alien species of central-western Argentina across five contrasting ecosystems and four land-use regimes, we tested these hypotheses over a broad range of habitats. We built a data set with common measurement methods and biogeographical factors but strongly varying environmental conditions, ranging from mesic to extremely dry, and from nearly pristine to heavily disturbed. 3 When considering all species together, the main trend of variation in trait syndromes was between acquisitive (tender, large leaves, with high specific area) and conservative (tough, small leaves, with low specific area and low nutrient content). Although both native and alien species appeared to be well spread across the whole range of trait variation, woody alien species showed a significantly more acquisitive set of attributes (higher specific leaf area, larger and thinner leaves, lower wood density) than native species. No significant difference was detected between herbaceous alien and native species. These general trends were maintained under contrasting climatic and land-use conditions. 4 Synthesis. The patterns detected for herbaceous species were in line with the 'join-the-locals' hypothesis. In contrast, those found for woody species, with woody alien species showing more acquisitive attributes than native species in more resource-rich habitats, provide partial support for the 'try-harder' hypothesis. Overall, our findings reinforce the idea that a universal suit of attributes is unlikely to explain alien plant distribution.

We examined hybridization at the molecular level, using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Approximately a quarter of the assayed North American diffuse knapweed individuals exhibited evidence of introgression from spotted knapweed. However, plants with intermediate morphology did not show evidence of mixed ancestry more often than the plants with typical diffuse knapweed morphology. The high proportion of hybrid individuals in North American diffuse knapweed sites found here, combined with evidence from recent studies, suggests that diffuse knapweed was likely introduced with admixed individuals, and the hybrids are not newly created postintroduction.

To better understand the ecology and nutrition of the C. brachypus invasion, we monitored benthic cover, water column dissolved inorganic nutrients, tissue C:N:P ratios and stable nitrogen isotopes (delta N-15) of C. brachypus and native chlorophytes (Caulerpa racemosa, Caulerpa verticillata, Caulerpa mexicana, Codium isthmocladum) quarterly at two reef sites - the Princess Anne (PA) and North Colonel's Ledge (NCL) - in 2003-2004. The PA site was influenced by stormwater discharges from the Lake Worth inlet whereas NCL was farther distant from these discharges. Between winter and spring of 2003, C. brachypus became the dominant benthic chlorophyte, expanding to >60% cover at both PA and NCL. Following cold temperatures (13 degrees C) associated with strong upwelling and high nitrate concentrations (21 mu M) at NCL in July 2003, C brachypus cover decreased, suggesting that upwelling can stress growth of this tropical alga. Mean ammonium (0.60 mu M), nitrate (2.7 mu M) and DIN (3.2 mu M) concentrations were high for coral reef environments. Low mean C:N ratios of similar to 13 in C. brachypus at both PA and NCL indicated little, if any, N-limitation compared to higher C:N ratios (up to 24) and greater N-limitation in native chlorophytes. Despite a relatively high mean SRP concentration (0.21 mu M), mean N:P ratios of similar to 39 in C. brachypus and other chlorophytes at PA and NCL suggested that these blooms were P-limited. Multiple lines of evidence support the hypothesis that land-based nutrient sources fueled the C. brachypus invasion. First, more persistent blooms of C brachypus at PA compared to NCL correlated with significantly lower tissue C:P and higher delta N-15 values (wet season) at PA, the site most directly influenced by land-based stormwater runoff. Second, C:N, C:P, and delta N-15 values of C. brachypus correlated with seasonal patterns of rainfall and stormwater runoff. Third, delta N-15 values of C. brachypus and other chlorophytes decreased at NCL following strong upwelling in July 2003, confirming that upwelled nitrate was not the cause of the elevated delta N-15 values observed in these blooms. Lastly, the mean delta N-15 values of C. brachypus and other chlorophytes off southeast Florida (+4.9 parts per thousand) were in the range of sewage nitrogen and significantly higher than values (+1.2 parts per thousand) for reference chlorophytes in the Abacos, Bahamas, an area that experiences relatively little sewage input.

We demonstrate this general phenomenon by using a model in which competition for nitrogen is mediated by soil moisture, with competitive outcomes including coexistence and multiple stable states as well as competitive exclusion. In the model, soil moisture regulates nitrogen availability through soil moisture dependence of microbial processes, leaching, and plant uptake. By affecting water availability, plants also indirectly affect nitrogen availability and may therefore alter the competitive outcome. Exotic annual species from the Mediterranean have displaced much of the native perennial grasses in California. Nitrogen and water have been shown to be potentially limiting in this system. We parameterize the model for a Californian grassland and show that soil moisture-mediated competition for nitrogen can explain the annual species' dominance in drier areas, with coexistence expected in wetter regions.

This contribution of integration to the invasiveness of clonal plants may be greater in denser communities. A greenhouse study was conducted to test these two hypotheses. High- and low-density communities were created by sowing seeds of eight grassland species. Each community was planted with three ramets of the stoloniferous, introduced plant Alternanthera philoxeroides that were disconnected from or left connected to ramets growing on bare soil. Connection increased the spread of Alternanthera within a community, but did not reduce community biomass. Alternanthera grew less in high-density communities, but connection did not improve its growth more than in low-density communities. Low-density Communities had higher evenness when Alternanthera was connected than when it was disconnected because shoot mass was lower in the more abundant species in the community and higher in the less abundant ones. These results partly supported the first hypothesis, but not the second. The effect of integration on community Structure could be due to higher resource import by the ramets of Alternanthera closer to the dominant species.

We found that land use history patterns strongly affected presence and abundance of the invasive plants as a group, but affected some species more than others. Generally, past agricultural use favored invasive species, whereas intact forest blocks discouraged them. Current land-use trends toward residential/commercial development favor disturbance-adapted species like Celastrus orbiculatus (asiatic bittersweet) and will probably slow the spread of post-agricultural specialists such as Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry).",Web of Science,Celastrus orbiculatus;Berberis thunbergii;Elaeagnus umbellata;Euonymus alata;Lonicera morrowii;Rosa multiflora,U.S.A.,Connecticut,Meshomasic State Forest,41.626461,-72.536087,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Urban;Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Here, we explore the relative effects of biological traits of plant species and their distributional characteristics in the native range on invasion success at two stages of invasion. Location Czech Republic (for native species); and the world (for alien species). Methods The source pool of 1218 species of seed plants native to Central Europe was derived from the flora of the Czech Republic, and their occurrence in 706 alien floras all over the world was recorded, distinguishing whether they were listed as an 'alien' or a 'weed' in the latest version of Randall's 'Global compendium of weeds' database. The latter type of occurrence was considered to indicate species ability to invade and cause economic impact, i.e. a more advanced stage of invasion. Using the statistical technique of regression trees, we tested whether 19 biological traits and five distributional characteristics of the species in their native range can be used to predict species success in two stages of invasion. Results The probability of a species becoming alien outside its native distribution range is determined by the size of its native range, and its tolerance of a wide range of climates acquired in the region of origin. Biological traits play only an indirect role at this stage of invasion via determining the size of the native range. However, the ability of species to become a weed is determined not only by the above characteristics of native distribution, but also directly by biological traits (life form and strategy, early flowering, tall stature, generative reproduction, number of ploidy levels and opportunistic dispersal by a number of vectors). Species phylogenetic relatedness plays only a minor role; it is more important at the lowest taxonomic levels and at the later stage of invasion. Main conclusion The global success of Central European species as 'weeds' is determined by their distributional characteristics in the native ranges and by biological traits, but the relative importance of these determinants depends on the stage of invasion. Species which have large native ranges and are common within these ranges should be paid increased attention upon introductions, and the above biological traits should be taken into account in screening systems applied to evaluate deliberate introductions of alien plants to new regions.",Web of Science,Many,Global,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Propagule Pressure;Other,Superior Competitor;Broad Tolerances;Effective Disperser,primary

For this invasion to be controlled, even partially, it is important to understand the dominant routes, mechanisms, and rates of weed spread across landscapes. With their linear corridors of disturbed habitats, roadsides are thought to play a large role in the spread of some weeds. We used both new surveys and existing data to assess which of the 328 environmental weeds listed by the Department of Conservation are most frequently found on roadsides, where, and whether distribution patterns are consistent with linear dispersal. We also analysed historical survey data for relationships between reserve weediness and proximity to roads. We surveyed 340 plots of 100-m-long stretches of roadside across four regions and found between 2 and 19 environmental weeds per plot; 128 species in total (Chao estimate 148). Especially abundant were agricultural species (weeds and cultivated), species that have been naturalised for well over 50 years, and species that disperse externally attached to vertebrates. While we purposefully sampled within 10 km of town limits, we found no strong effect of distance from town on roadside weed richness, including richness of just ornamentally sourced weeds. Instead, number of houses within 250 m and presence of an adjacent house or other residential structure were both important, as was presence of woody vegetation on and adjacent to roadsides. Reserves adjacent to roads had significantly higher weed richness than reserves further from roads, although the causal mechanisms are unclear. Our results suggest that while roadsides include suitable habitats for most environmental weeds, distributions are patchy and roads show little sign of acting as linear dispersal corridors, instead largely reflecting neighbouring land uses. As such, roadside weeds should best be managed as part of the wider landscape.",Web of Science,Many,Australia,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

We asked whether cheatgrass is capable of becoming adapted to a marginal habitat, by investigating a population at a high elevation invasion edge. We used a combination of methods, including reciprocal field transplants, controlled environment studies and molecular analysis. High levels of SSR gene diversity (0.50 vs. 0.43) and comparable variation in phenotypic traits were observed at both the invasion edge and a low elevation, high-density population. Three heterozygotes were observed in the edge population, which is unusual in this predominantly self-pollinating plant. Plants from high elevations germinated more slowly in a growth chamber and had slower seedling growth rates. Survivorship was low at the edge (13%), compared with the low elevation site (55%), but surviving plants were of similar size and had equivalent reproductive output. Seed size positively affected survival and plant performance in the field and this trait was inherited. Emergence timing affected survival at the low elevation site and germination timing was also inherited. Local adaptation was seen in the low, rather than in the high elevation site, because of differential survival. While there was no evidence for local adaptation to the high elevation site observed in the field, family level and genotype-level differences in traits that affected field performance, high genetic diversity at the invasion edge, and evidence of outcrossing in this highly selfing species indicates that the potential for adaptation to a marginal habitat exists within this population.",Web of Science,Bromus tectorum,USA,Nevada,,39.589286,-119.929504,Field - Experimental;Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

The first required comparisons of the salinity and temperature tolerances and other attributes of eggs, juveniles and adults to reveal differences that might account for the relative abundances of the species. As anticipated, P. acuta proved to have higher fecundity, shorter hatching time and higher salinity and temperature tolerances than G. gibbosa. The second hypothesis concerned a possible competitive interaction between the species. This was confirmed, as when juveniles were kept together, under laboratory conditions, the growth rate of P. acuta increased and that of G. gibbosa decreased (with some mortality).

However, rigorous investigations of this idea using cross-continental comparisons, including native and invasive plant populations, are still scarce. We investigated if interactions with the soil community affect the growth and biomass allocation of the (sub)tropical invasive shrub Chromolaena odorata. We performed a cross-continental comparison with both native and non-native-range soil and native and non-native-range plant populations in two glasshouse experiments. Results are interpreted in the light of three prominent hypotheses that explain the dominance of invasive plants in the non-native range: the enemy release hypothesis, the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis and the accumulation of local pathogens hypothesis. Our results show that C. odorata performed significantly better when grown in soil pre-cultured by a plant species other than C. odorata. Soil communities from the native and non-native ranges did not differ in their effect on C. odorata performance. However, soil origin had a significant effect on plant allocation responses. Non-native C. odorata plants increased relative allocation to stem biomass and height growth when confronted with soil communities from the non-native range. This is a plastic response that may allow species to be more successful when competing for light. This response differed between native and non-native-range populations, suggesting that selection may have taken place during the process of invasion. Whether this plastic response to soil organisms will indeed select for increased competitive ability needs further study. The native grass Panicum maximum did not perform worse when grown in soil pre-cultured by C. odorata. Therefore, our results did not support the accumulation of local pathogens hypothesis. Synthesis. Non-native C. odorata did not show release from soil-borne enemies compared to its native range. However, non-native plants responded to soil biota from the non-native range by enhanced allocation in stem biomass and height growth. This response can affect the competitive balance between native and invasive species.

In Switzerland, roadsides are subjected to regular mowing, and to persist in these sites, plants must be able to compensate for the biomass removal. However, the ability to tolerate competition and mowing might decline under less favourable growth conditions, such as those at higher altitudes. I investigated how competition and mowing affect growth and reproduction of Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers., an invasive plant common on Swiss roadsides, and how these effects change with altitude. The experiment was replicated in common gardens at altitudes of 400 m and 1,000 m asl, representing growth conditions in the main distribution area of E. annuus and at its altitudinal limit, respectively. Vegetative growth was negatively affected by competition at both sites, but especially at 1,000 m. The number of capitula was not affected by competition at 400 m, but was reduced at 1,000 m. Plants regrew vigorously after mowing in both gardens. The effects of mowing on reproductive output were positive at 400 m, but negative at 1,000 m.

I tested these life-history predictions and explored how they might differ between the native and introduced ranges of the monocarpic perennial Cynoglossum officinale. I first compared vital rates between ranges. I then used these vital rates to parameterize integral projection models to calculate the population growth rate (lambda) and net reproductive rate (R-0) as surrogates for fitness to compare strategies within and between ranges. I found that both survival and growth were higher in the introduced range, where size at flowering was larger and iteroparity was much more common than in the native range. The observed and predicted strategies for size at flowering were similar in the native range. In the introduced range, however, even though plants flowered at a larger size, the observed size was not as large as the optimum predicted by lambda or the higher optimum predicted by R-0.

We combined life history and physiologic traits into a single principal component (PCALL) and also compared subsets of traits related to size, reproduction, and defense (PCSIZE, PCREP, and PCDEF, respectively). On average, introduced populations exhibited increased growth and reproduction compared to native conspecifics when latitude was not included in statistical models. However, significant correlations between PC-scores and latitude were detected in both the native and introduced ranges, indicating population differentiation along latitudinal gradients.

Location Grands Causses, calcareous plateaus (Southern France). Methods We used both published and unpublished demographic and dispersal data to assess population growth and invasion speed of invading pines. A demographic and spatially explicit model, which included density dependence and stochasticity in dispersal, demography and environment, was run for different scenarios of sheep grazing pressure (nil, extensive or intensive), shrub cover (0, 10 or 20%) and drought frequency (past-to-present or future). For each scenario, population growth rate, invasion speed and elasticity of invasion speed to each demographic and dispersal parameter were computed. Results Grazing was the main factor for limiting invasion speed. Shrub cover reduced tree spread under nil or extensive grazing pressure, but increased it under intensive grazing pressure. Although dry years led to nil seedling establishment rates, an increase in their frequency had surprisingly few effects on pine invasion speed. This last result remained unchanged when very dry years, inducing seedling, but also sapling mortality were introduced. In most environmental conditions, population growth rate and invasion speed were higher for the introduced than for the native pine. Elasticity analysis highlighted the importance of demographic parameters on invasion speed, notably adult and sapling survival.

We found that freshwater macroinvertebrate invaders are not a random selection of species, and are over-represented by molluscs and crustaceans, while taxa richness of native communities are dominated by insects. Over 35% of native species of aquatic invertebrates in North America are only able to live in areas with excellent or very good water quality, and are intolerant of organic pollution.

The ongoing spread of exotic species affects the biodiversity of selected taxa, shifts communities toward greater tolerance of organic pollution and increases the numbers of suspension feeders, thereby enhancing benthic pelagic coupling in waterbodies with high densities of invaders.

In the Austrian stretch of the River Danube it was not found before 1989, and not before 1992 in the Bavarian Danube. It very quickly spread to Germany, the Netherlands, and France via the so called *Southern Corridor*. The invader also migrates via the *Central Corridor*, reaching as far west as the Vistula River. The species has been reported from a number of lakes. Reasons for the quick spread and high abundance are, beside others, its life history traits. A population of this invasive species was studied from 2002 to 2004 in the Austrian stretch of the Danube. The following life-history traits are important in the invasion success: long reproductive period, early sexual maturity, short generation time, a life span not exceeding 1 year (up to three generations and 14 cohorts being present at the same time), high growth rates resulting in large body size, short duration of embryonic development, large numbers of comparatively small eggs in the brood pouch, large reproductive capacity, and optimal timing to release the maximum number of neonates per female in May/June (maximising rapid growth at high summer temperatures and at times of plentiful food), increasing mating privilege for large specimens of both sexes with decreasing water temperatures during winter. These life cycle characteristics together with its predatory behaviour and its ability to cope with variation in oxygen, temperature and salinity, give this invader a potential to become distributed in freshwater ecosystems of the temperate climate zone all over the world.

We conducted comparisons between the flowering phenology of the invasive species in their native range and in Spain, and between flowering phenology of 91 coexisting invasive-native species pairs.

Flowering of tropical and temperate invasive alien species peaked in summer, which contrasts with the spring flowering of native and invasive alien species of Mediterranean climate origin.

Allelopathic interactions between invasive and native species have been suggested to be an important mechanism for the success of some of the most aggressive plant invaders. However, field experiments that test the effects of natural levels of allelopathic compounds on coexisting native species are exceptionally rare. 2. In this study, we analyzed the allelopathic effects of the invasive tree Ailanthus altissima on seedling emergence, survival and growth of three native tree species (Acer rubrum, A. saccharum and Quercus rubra) in temperate forests of the northeastern United States. We used activated carbon (AC) to reduce potential allelopathic interference, and developed neighbourhood models that explain the observed spatial variation in the effects of the AC treatments on seedling performance as a function of the size, abundance and distribution of Ailanthus trees in the neighbourhood. 3. Our results showed that the addition of AC to the soil did not affect seedling emergence or survival, but caused a significant increase in seedling growth of all three species. Moreover, the AC shifted the overall interaction between Ailanthus and maple seedlings from neutral or slightly positive to very positive for A. rubrum, and from negative to positive for A. saccharum, whereas the net interaction between Ailanthus and Q. rubra was always negative. As Ailanthus has the ability to increase soil fertility, these species-specific responses are presumably influenced by among-species differences in the net effects of both allelopathy and changes in resource availability caused by the presence of Ailanthus. 4. The cumulative allelopathic effects of Ailanthus were proportional to the density of Ailanthus in the neighbourhood, regardless of their size. In contrast, Ailanthus effects were strongly influenced by distance from a tree, generally dropping to zero within 5 m from the trunk. 5. Synthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that allelopathy is an important mechanism to take into account when trying to understand the causes and consequences of plant invasions.

When a plant species is introduced into a new range, it may differentiate genetically from the original populations in the home range. This genetic differentiation may influence the extent to which the invasion of the new range is successful. We tested this hypothesis by examining Senecio pterophorus, a South African shrub that was introduced into NE Spain about 40 years ago. We predicted that in the introduced range invasive populations would perform better and show greater plasticity than native populations. 2. Individuals of S. pterophorus from four Spanish (invasive) and four South African (native) populations were grown in Catalonia, Spain, in a common garden in which disturbance and water availability were manipulated. Fitness traits and several ecophysiological parameters were measured. 3. The invasive populations of S. pterophorus survived better throughout the summer drought in a disturbed (unvegetated) environment than native South African populations. This success may be attributable to the lower specific leaf area (SLA) and better water content regulation of the invasive populations in this treatment. 4. Invasive populations displayed up to three times higher relative growth rate than native populations under conditions of disturbance and non-limiting water availability. 5. The reproductive performance of the invasive populations was higher in all treatments except under the most stressful conditions (i.e. in non-watered undisturbed plots), where no plant from either population flowered. 6. The results for leaf parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements suggested that the greater fitness of the invasive populations could be attributed to more favourable ecophysiological responses. 7. Synthesis. Spanish invasive populations of S. pterophorus performed better in the presence of high levels of disturbance, and displayed higher plasticity of fitness traits in response to resource availability than native South African populations. Our results suggest that genetic differentiation from source populations associated with founding may play a role in invasion success.",Web of Science,Senecio pterophorus,Spain,Catalonia,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary

Deer preference for exotic and native trees on Isla Victoria, Argentina",journal,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,33,3,317,323,"How interactions between exotic species affect invasion impact is a fundamental issue on both theoretical and applied grounds. Exotics can facilitate establishment and invasion of other exotics (invasional meltdown) or they can restrict them by re-establishing natural population control (as predicted by the enemy-release hypothesis). We studied forest invasion on an Argentinean island where 43 species of Pinaceae, including 60% of the world's recorded invasive Pinaceae, were introduced c. 1920 but where few species are colonizing pristine areas. In this area two species of Palearctic deer, natural enemies of most Pinaceae, were introduced 80 years ago. Expecting deer to help to control the exotics, we conducted a cafeteria experiment to assess deer preferences among the two dominant native species (a conifer, Austrocedrus chilensis, and a broadleaf, Nothofagus dombeyi) and two widely introduced exotic tree species (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus ponderosa). Deer browsed much more intensively on native species than on exotic conifers, in terms of number of individuals attacked and degree of browsing. Deer preference for natives could potentially facilitate invasion by exotic pines. However, we hypothesize that the low rates of invasion currently observed can result at least partly from high densities of exotic deer, which, despite their preference for natives, can prevent establishment of both native and exotic trees. Other factors, not mutually exclusive, could produce the observed pattern.

It gives urgency to a better understanding of the factors that affect marine biological invasions. A chemoecological approach is proposed here to define biotic conditions that promote biological invasions in terms of enemy escape and resource opportunities. Research has focused on the secondary metabolite composition of three exotic sea slugs found in Greece that have most probably entered the Mediterranean basin by Lessepsian migration, an exchange that contributes significantly to Mediterranean biodiversity. We have found toxic compounds with significant activity as feeding deterrents both in the cephalaspidean Haminoea cyanomarginata and in the nudibranch Melibe viridis. These findings led us to propose aposematism in the former and dietary autonomy in producing defensive metabolites in the latter case, as predisposing factors to the migration. In the third mollusk investigated, the anaspidean Syphonota geographica, the topic of marine invasions has been approached through a study of its feeding biology. The identification of the same compounds from both the viscera of each individual, separately analyzed, and their food, the seagrass Halophila stipulacea, implies a dietary dependency. The survival of S. geographica in the Mediterranean seems to be related to the presence of H. stipulacea.

The novel weapons hypothesis has been suggested as one mechanism for invasion and spread of exotic plant species. It states that exotic species with *new weapons*, such as allelopathic chemicals, may have greater impacts on species in the invaded range without co-evolved defense strategies against the exotic chemicals. In Florida, one successful exotic species, Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper), has invaded nearly every habitat throughout the state. Past studies have documented allelopathic properties of S. terebinthifolius negatively impacting the growth of native terrestrial flora. Here we document the effect of S. terebinthifolius for the first time on mangrove systems. We examined growth and survival of Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) seedlings when exposed to a range of densities of intact and crushed S. terebinthifolius fruits (0, 25, 50) at two different salinities (15, 30 ppt). We also documented the natural density of S. terebinthifolius fruits beneath the tree canopy after fruit production in mangrove habitat. Growth and biomass were significantly reduced in A. germinans when exposed to the highest density of intact S. terebinthifolius fruits growing in 30 ppt saltwater. Trials with intact fruits had no significant effects on R. mangle; however, crushed fruits significantly decreased growth, and leaf production. The ecological importance of the different effects of crushed and intact fruits is supported by field observations which found equal or greater numbers of crushed fruits compared to intact fruits beneath the tree canopy of female S. terebinthifolius. In addition, abiotic factors, such as salinity, may interact with allelopathic chemicals in natural systems and needs to be addressed when planning future allelopathic studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We created a database of the alien plants in seminatural habitats in Ireland that included data on taxonomy, invasive status, invasion history, distribution, and biological and ecological plant characteristics. We used information from this database to determine the importance of these factors in increasing the ability of species to become naturalized and invasive. More specifically, we used two multiple logistic regressions toy factors that distinguish naturalized from casual alien plant species and invasive from noninvasive, identify naturalized alien species. Clonal growth, moisture-indicator value, nitrogen-indicator value, native range, and date of first record affected (in order of decreasing importance) the probability of naturalization. Factors that distinguished invasive from noninvasive species were ornamental introduction, hermaphrodite flowers, pollination mode, being invasive elsewhere, onset of flowering season, moisture-indicator value, native range, and date of first record. Incorporation of phylogenetic information had little influence on the results, suggesting that the capacity of alien species to naturalize and become invasive evolved largely independently in several phylogenetic lineages. Whereas some of the variables were important for both transitions, others were only important for naturalization or for invasion. This emphasizes the importance of studying different stages of the invasion process when looking for mechanisms of becoming a successful invasive plant, instead of simply comparing invasive with noninvasive alien species.

A link between the species richness of an area and the number of invasive species coming from this area was observed, showing that rich areas are more prone to shelter potential invaders than others. The patterns of gammarid dispersals among European waterways suggest that, rather than a random distribution of invaders, a clump occurred in basins which served as refuge areas during the last glaciations.

However, lower seed reserves per embryo in polyembryonic seeds may entail costs in low-light environments.

Contrary to expectations, seed embryo number had no effect on the final height, survival, or dry mass of plants in either habitat.

M.",2008,Effects of pre-existing submersed vegetation and propagule pressure on the invasion success of Hydrilla verticillata,journal,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,45,2,515,523,"1. With biological invasions causing widespread problems in ecosystems, methods to curb the colonization success of invasive species are needed. The effective management of invasive species will require an integrated approach that restores community structure and ecosystem processes while controlling propagule pressure of non-native species. 2. We tested the hypotheses that restoring native vegetation and minimizing propagule pressure of invasive species slows the establishment of an invader. In field and greenhouse experiments, we evaluated (i) the effects of a native submersed aquatic plant species, Vallisneria americana, on the colonization success of a non-native species, Hydrilla verticillata; and (ii) the effects of H. verticillata propagule density on its colonization success. 3. Results from the greenhouse experiment showed that V. americana decreased H. verticillata colonization through nutrient draw-down in the water column of closed mesocosms, although data from the field experiment, located in a tidal freshwater region of Chesapeake Bay that is open to nutrient fluxes, suggested that V. americana did not negatively impact H. verticillata colonization. However, H. verticillata colonization was greater in a treatment of plastic V. americana look-alikes, suggesting that the canopy of V. americana can physically capture H. verticillata fragments. Thus pre-emption effects may be less clear in the field experiment because of complex interactions between competitive and facilitative effects in combination with continuous nutrient inputs from tides and rivers that do not allow nutrient draw-down to levels experienced in the greenhouse. 4. Greenhouse and field tests differed in the timing, duration and density of propagule inputs. However, irrespective of these differences, propagule pressure of the invader affected colonization success except in situations when the native species could draw-down nutrients in closed greenhouse mesocosms. In that case, no propagules were able to colonize. 5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that reducing propagule pressure through targeted management should be considered to slow the spread of invasive species. This, in combination with restoration of native species, may be the best defence against non-native species invasion. Thus a combined strategy of targeted control and promotion of native plant growth is likely to be the most sustainable and cost-effective form of invasive species management.",Web of Science,Hydrilla verticillata,United States,Maryland,Otter Point Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve,39.45,-76.2667,Field - Experimental;Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,primary

Plants grown from these seeds were either subjected to herbivory by two insects from Australia that have recently been released as biological control agents or protected from herbivores using insecticides. Genotypes from the introduced range were initially more attractive to herbivores than genotypes from the home range, supporting EICA. However, genotypes from the introduced and home range did not differ in resistance to insects or in competitive ability, which does not support EICA.

Mediterranean south-central Chile may be especially prone to the effects of invasive species on fire regimes because it is less adapted to fire and it contains a highly endemic flora. Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch (syn. Cytisus monspessulanus L.; Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S.

Dense T. monspessulana stands are completely destroyed by fire, generating the conditions for it seeds to germinate and establish an abundant regeneration, with up to 900 plants/m(2). We report key evidence on abundance and biomass in adult stands, and patterns of seed bank and regeneration after fire in stands of T. monspessulana around the city of Concepcion, Chile. We estimated living biomass in pure stands and underneath Eucalyptus plantations. In burned areas, we assessed T. monspessulana seed bank and studied regeneration patterns. We found that T. monspessulana densities reaches 52,778 plants/ha and 8.92 ton/ha in pure stands and 34,223 plants/ha and 2.31 ton/ha underneath Eucalyptus plantations. T. monspessulana generates small caliper fuel and acts as a ladder-fuel. Large soil seed banks allow for abundant regeneration after fire, with mean densities of 877,111 plants/ha, but an overall mortality of 37.2% in the first year after the fire. The high values of regeneration compared to final densities in adult stands suggest that density-dependent mortality. Our results indicate that T. monspessulana regeneration is not only favored by fires, but also that the species creates favorable conditions for intense and continuous fires, both under pure conditions, but also associated to exotic tree plantations. To understand the implications of positive feedbacks between invaders and fire, we recommend focusing in the mechanisms by which they increases fuel accumulation and fuel flammability, and how higher fire frequency and intensity favors invasive species recruitment over native species.

Ecological theory predicts, and small-scale experiments confirm, lower levels of nonnative species invasion into species-rich compared to species-poor communities, but observational studies across a wider range of scales often report positive relationships between native and nonnative species richness. This paradox has been attributed to the scale dependency of diversity-invasibility relationships and to differences between experimental and observational studies. Disturbance is widely recognized as an important factor determining invasibility of communities, but few studies have investigated the relative and interactive roles of diversity and disturbance on nonnative species invasion. Here, we report how the relationship between native and nonnative plant species richness responded to an experimentally applied disturbance gradient (from no disturbance up to clearcut) in oak-dominated forests. We consider whether results are consistent with various explanations of diversity-invasibility relationships including biotic resistance, resource availability, and the potential effects of scale (I m 2 to 2 ha). We found no correlation between native and normative species richness before disturbance except at the largest spatial scale, but a positive relationship after disturbance across scales and levels of disturbance.

We tested the EICA hypothesis in a common garden experiment with Sapium sebiferum in which seedlings from native (China) and invasive (USA) populations were grown in all pairwise combinations in the native range (China) in the presence of herbivores. When paired seedlings were from the same continent, shoot mass and leaf damage per seedling were significantly greater for plants from invasive populations than those from native populations. Despite more damage from herbivores, plants from invasive populations still outperformed those from native populations when they were grown together. Increased competitive ability and higher herbivory damage of invasive populations relative to native populations of S. sebiferum support the EICA hypothesis. Regression of biomass against percent leaf damage showed that plants from invasive populations tolerated herbivory more effectively than those from native populations. The results of this study suggest that S. sebiferum has become a faster-growing, less herbivore-resistant, and more herbivore-tolerant plant in the introduced range.

This novel approach allowed us to compare the relative damage from mammal and insect herbivores and whether damage rates were related to invasion. In a greenhouse experiment, we simulated herbivory through clipping and measured growth response. After two seasons of excluding herbivores, there was no difference in relative growth rates among invasive, naturalized, and native woody vines, and all vines were susceptible to damage from mammal and insect herbivores. Thus, differential attack by herbivores and plant resistance to herbivory did not explain invasion success of these species. In the field, where damage rates were high, none of the vines were able to fully compensate for damage from mammals.

Hybrid seed comprised 91% to 98% of that set in the marsh study plants over the 2 years of the study. Total viable pollen production by hybrid plants was 400 times that of the native plants. Seed and pollen production were highly skewed towards a few hybrid genotypes. In addition to seed produced by hybrid plants, hybrid seed was produced by S. foliosa due to hybrid backcrossing. While the greatest advantage for hybrids was in pollen and seed production, hybrid seeds germinated, and seedlings survived and grew as well or better than the native species. As native S. foliosa becomes increasingly rare, hybrid seed floating on the tides will predominate, overwhelming recruitment sites and resulting in further colonization by hybrids. In an evolutionary context, hybrids with exceptional pollen and seed production will be initially favoured by natural selection, leading to the evolution of even more fertile hybrid genotypes.",Web of Science,Spartina alterniflora,United States,Calfornia,San Francisco Bay,37.6467,-122.1433,Field - Observational;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Wetland,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,primary

We tried to test these three hypotheses in the special case of the American black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), a gap-dependent tree species, which is invading European temperate forests. We compared plant communities, soil properties, and disturbance history between P. serotina-invaded and uninvaded paired-stands in a managed mixed forest. Relationships between invasion, disturbances, plant communities, and environmental conditions were investigated using redundancy analyses with variation partitioning. Several soil characteristics differed between paired stands, but were rather components of stand invasibility than invasion effects, except for topsoil available phosphorus. The disturbance history was similar among paired stands except for the amount of storm-induced tree falls, which correlated with the invader's density. Wild boar-disturbed soil areas were more important beneath P. serotina canopies, suggesting a positive feedback on its own establishment. Overall, species assemblages in invaded and uninvaded stands were similar; their ecological inconsistency suggested a management-sustained non-equilibrium. Habitat conditions and disturbances explained most of the variation in both plant diversity and P. serotina density, the last two factors exhibiting a weak direct association.

Here, we studied abundance, growth, reproduction, and herbivory in 10 native Chinese and 10 invasive German populations of the invasive shrub Buddleja davidii (Scrophulariaceae; butterfly bush). We found strong evidence for increased plant vigour in the introduced range: plants in invasive populations were significantly taller and had thicker stems, larger inflorescences, and heavier seeds than plants in native populations. These differences in plant performance could not be explained by a more benign climate in the introduced range.

A baseline survey of native and NIS was undertaken in conjunction with a manipulative experiment to determine the effect that heavy metal pollution had on the diversity and invasibility of marine hard-substrate assemblages. The study was repeated at two sites in each of two harbours in New South Wales, Australia. The survey sampled a total of 47 sessile invertebrate taxa, of which 15 (32%) were identified as native, 19 (40%) as NIS, and 13 (28%) as cryptogenic. Increasing pollution exposure decreased native species diversity at all study sites by between 33% and 50%. In contrast, there was no significant change in the numbers of NIS. Percentage cover was used as a measure of spatial dominance, with increased pollution exposure leading to increased NIS dominance across all sites. At three of the four study sites, assemblages that had previously been dominated by natives changed to become either extensively dominated by NIS or equally occupied by native and NIS alike. No single native or NIS was repeatedly responsible for the observed changes in native species diversity or NIS dominance at all sites. Rather, the observed effects of pollution were driven by a diverse range of taxa and species. These findings have important implications for both the way we assess pollution impacts, and for the management of NIS. When monitoring the response of assemblages to pollution, it is not sufficient to simply assess changes in community diversity. Rather, it is important to distinguish native from NIS components since both are expected to respond differently.

The rate of invasion was evaluated using inclusion curves, by plotting the cumulative number of invaded countries against time on the continental scale of Europe, number of occupied grid cells at the regional scale of the Czech Republic, and invaded area inferred from a series of aerial photographs taken at the local scale over a period of 49 years in the Slavkovky les region, Czech Republic. Time of 50% inclusion (with 95% confidence intervals, CI) of invaded countries, occupied grid cells, and invaded area was assessed. The invasion was slowest at the continental scale (62 years, CI = 53-70) and did not differ significantly between regional (16 years, CI = 10-20) and local (22 years, CI = 19-24) scales. Our results indicate that there are two different mechanisms of spread acting together in this system, namely human influences and natural spread, and the relative influence of these mechanisms appears to change in an inverse proportion from the largest to the smallest scale. At the local scale, under suitable habitat conditions, the process is driven by biological traits of the species related to dispersal. At the continental and regional scales, humans played a crucial role in the invasion of H. mantegazzianum by planting it as a garden ornamental. At these scales, human-mediated dispersal seems to have been the major driver of spread, responsible for creating dispersal foci in the initial phases of invasion.

We related the extent of species distributions in each region to growth form and the distinction between upland and wetland habitats. We identified significant relationships between geographical distribution and plant traits in both native and exotic ranges as well as regional differences in the relationships. Range size was larger for herbaceous graminoids and forbs, especially annuals compared to perennials, than for woody species, and range size also was larger for plants of wetland compared to upland habitats. Distributions were more extensive in North America than in Eastern Asia, although native plants from both regions had broader distributions than non-natives, with exotics from elsewhere intermediate. Growth form and environment explained more of the variance in distribution of plants in North America than in Eastern Asia.

At present, attempts to build consensus as to what the primary drivers of plant invasion in riparian ecosystems might be is hindered by the absence of common standards for data collected on plant species (e.g. occurrence, or relative abundance). Mimulus guttatus L., a non-native riparian plant species, was used as a model to determine how environmental drivers influence two aspects of invasibility: species occurrence and abundance (assessed in relation to three variables number of patches, patch area and number of stems per patch). Mimulus occurrence and abundance, together with 20 environmental variables, were surveyed in almost 700 contiguous 50-m-long riverbank segments within a catchment in north-east Scotland. More than half of the segments had been colonized by Mimulus. Occurrence and number of patches responded to similar environmental gradients, particularly bare sediment, boulders, high soil moisture, short-statured ruderal communities, and open canopies, and tended to be highest downstream where the river was widest. In contrast to occurrence and patch number, patch area and stem number per patch were higher in the upper reaches of the catchment and were positively associated with low tree canopy and vegetation dominated by light-demanding species and smaller-statured species. Patch area and stem number per patch were also positively related to grazing. This study has highlighted the importance of assessing more than one measure of invasion success (occurrence or patch number and either patch area or stem number per patch), as they are each determined by a different suite of environmental variables. Abiotic factors, such as sediment availability and presence of boulders, appeared to be the major determinants of occurrence and patch number, whereas biotic factors, such as interspecific competition and grazing, were more important ecological determinants underlying area and stem number per patch.",Web of Science,Mimulus guttatus,Scotland,,,57.1167,-2.85,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Here, we describe dispersal kernels generated by a native disperser, the endangered southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius, L.) for an invasive, tropical rainforest plant, pond apple (Annona glabra, L.). Pond apple is primarily water-dispersed and is managed as such. We consider whether cassowary dispersal, as a numerically subordinate dispersal mode, provides an additional dispersal service that may modify the invasion process. In infested areas, pond apple seed was common in cassowary dung. Gut passage had no effect on the probability of single seed germination but deposition in clumps or as whole fruits reduced the probability of germination below that of single seeds. Gut passage times ranged from 65 to 1675 min. Combined with cassowary movement data, this resulted in estimated dispersal distances of 12.5-5212 m, with a median distance of 387 m (quartile range 112-787 m). Native frugivores can be effective dispersers of weeds in rainforest and even terrestrial dispersers can provide long-distance dispersal. Importantly, though pond apple might be expected to be almost entirely dispersed downstream and along the margins of aquatic and marine habitats, cassowaries provide dispersal upstream and between drainages, leading to novel dispersal outcomes. Even through the provision of small quantities of novel dispersal outcomes, subordinate dispersal modes can play a significant role in determining invasion pattern and influence the ultimate success of control programs by providing dispersal to locations unattainable via the primary mode.",Web of Science,Annona glabra,Australia,Queensland,,-17.5333,146.0333,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

In a glasshouse, these three invasives or a group of native species were grown separately through three cycles of growth and soil conditioning in both steam-pasteurized and non-pasteurized soils, after which we assessed seedling growth in these soils.

Both Agropyron and Euphorbia consistently suppressed growth of two of three native forbs, while three native grasses were generally less affected. Almost all intra- and interspecific effects of invasive soil conditioning were dependent upon presence of soil biota from field sites where these species were successful invaders.

In contrast to other alien species that are restricted to human-disturbed sites at high elevations, T. officinale is frequently observed growing within native plant communities dominated by cushion plants. We selected sites where two cushion species coexist (Laretia acaulis and Azorella monantha), and evaluated whether T. officinale is equally associated with the two cushion species or shows a preference for one of them. We assessed facilitative effects of the two cushion species on T. officinale via seedling survival experiments, measurements of photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm and Phi PSII), reproductive output and recording the differences in soil temperature, humidity and nutrient contents between these cushion species and open areas. Taraxacum officinale was significantly and positively associated with only one of the two cushion species (A. monantha).

In the Iberian Peninsula, the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is an invasive species that is competing and displacing the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa).

We examined whether interspecific differences in responses to predation risk affect the time that turtles remained hidden in the shell before using an active escape to water. Both turtle species adjusted hiding times by balancing predation threat, microhabitat conditions and the costs of remaining hidden. However, introduced T. scripta showed longer hiding times before escaping than native M. Leprosa, which, in contrast, switched from waiting hidden in the shell to escape to deep water as soon as possible. These interspecific differences might result from the risk of facing different types of predators in different microhabitats (land vs. water) in their original habitats. However, in anthropogenically altered habitats where predators have been greatly reduced, T. scripta may avoid potential costs of unnecessary repeated escape responses to water (e.g. interruption of basking).

The pattern at small scales has been interpreted as evidence that native plants can competitively exclude invasive species. Large-scale patterns have been understood to result from environmental heterogeneity, among other causes. We investigated species richness patterns among submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants (87 native species and eight invasives) in 103 temperate lakes in Connecticut (northeastern USA) and found neither a consistently negative relationship at small (3-m(2)) scales, nor a positive relationship at large scales. Native species richness at sampling locations was uncorrelated with invasive species richness in 37 of the 60 lakes where invasive plants occurred; richness was negatively correlated in 16 lakes and positively correlated in seven. No correlation between native and invasive species richness was found at larger spatial scales (whole lakes and counties). Increases in richness with area were uncorrelated with abiotic heterogeneity. Logistic regression showed that the probability of occurrence of five invasive species increased in sampling locations (3 m(2), n = 2980 samples) where native plants occurred, indicating that native plant species richness provided no resistance against invasion. However, the probability of three invasive species' occurrence declined as native plant density increased, indicating that density, if not species richness, provided some resistance with these species. Density had no effect on occurrence of three other invasive species. Based on these results, native species may resist invasion at small spatial scales only in communities where density is high (i.e., in communities where competition among individuals contributes to community structure). Most hydrophyte communities, however, appear to be maintained in a nonequilibrial condition by stress and/or disturbance. Therefore, most aquatic plant communities in temperate lakes are likely to be vulnerable to invasion.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Connecticut,,,,Field - Observational,lentic,,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

We analyzed an 8-year record of stable isotope data on Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) from southern California to infer how the trophic position of this widespread invasive species changes over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope data (delta N-15) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California (introduced range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile differs between native and introduced populations, and (h) how relative trophic position as estimated by delta N-15 values of Argentine ants compare with those of other ants at the same site. Both long-term and biregional comparisons indicate that the Argentine ant's relative trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer history of occupation. over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position of L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but declined, on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared. Relative to native populations, where L. humile is among the most carnivorous of ants, Argentine ants from California occupied lower trophic positions. These results support the hypothesis that Argentine ants shift their diet after establishment as a result of resource depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, especially honeydew-producing Hemiptera.

For example, evolution over ecologically relevant timescales is expected in populations that colonize new habitats, where it should theoretically enhance fitness, associated vital rates of survival and reproduction, and population growth potential. Nonetheless, success of exotic species is much more commonly attributed to ecological aspects of habitat quality and 'escape from enemies' in the invaded range. Here, we consider contemporary evolution of vital rates in introduced Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that quickly colonized New Zealand and diverged over c. 26 generations. By using experimental translocations, we partitioned the roles of evolution and habitat quality in modifying geographical patterns of vital rates. Variation in habitat quality within the new range had the greatest influence on broad geographical patterns of vital rates, but locally adapted salmon still exhibited more than double the vital rate performance, and hence fitness, of nonlocal counterparts. The scope of this fitness evolution far exceeds the scale of divergence in trait values for these populations, or even the expected fitness effects of particular traits.

Reduction in genetic variation in introduced species may limit population growth, increase the risk of extinction, and constrain adaptation, hindering the successful establishment and spread of an alien species. Results of recent empirical studies, however, show higher than expected genetic variation, rapid evolution, and multiple native-range sources in introduced populations, which challenge the classical scenario of invasive-species genetics. With mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data, we examined the molecular genetics of 10 replicate introductions of 8 species of Anolis lizards. Eighty percent of introductions to Florida and the Dominican Republic were from multiple native-range source populations. MtDNA haplotypes restricted to different geographically distinct populations in the native range of a species commonly occurred as intrapopulation polymorphisms in introduced populations. Two-thirds of introduced populations had two or more sources, and admixture elevated genetic variation in half of the introduced populations above levels typical of native-range populations. The mean pairwise sequence divergence among haplotypes sampled within introduced populations was nearly twice that within native-range populations (2.6% vs. 1.4%). The dynamics of introductions from multiple sources and admixture explained the observed genetic contrasts between native and introduced Anolis populations better than the classical scenario for most introduced populations. Elevated genetic variation through admixture occurred regardless of the mode or circumstances of an introduction. Little insight into the number of sources or amount of genetic variation in introduced populations was gained by knowing the number of physical introductions, the size of a species' non-native range, or whether it was a deliberate or accidental introduction. We hypothesize that elevated genetic variation through admixture of multiple sources is more common in biological invasions than previously thought. We propose that introductions follow a sequential, two-step process involving a reduction in genetic variation due to founder effects and population bottlenecks followed by an increase in genetic variation if admixture of individuals from multiple native-range sources occurs.",Web of Science,Many,USA; Dominican Republic,Florida,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Subtropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,omnivore

The main habitat differentiation criterion was the absence or presence of visible signs of recent disturbances. Plant functional group richness (i.e. number of plant groups classified as grasses, herbs, shrubs, vines and trees), total plant cover and percentage of bare ground was calculated in each habitat. in addition, soil samples were randomly taken in order to analyse total soil C, total N, CaCO3, pH and soil texture. Cortaderia selloana populations were characterized by calculating total density, proportion of juvenile plants, plant volume, number of panicles and reproductive effort (i.e. number of panicles/plant volume) and fecundity per unit area (number of panicles per ha). We compared whether population characteristics and plant performance were associated with biotic and abiotic habitat factors. We expected a better performance of C. selloana in ruderal habitats than in non-ruderal habitats. As expected, ruderal habitats had larger and denser C. selloana populations and recruitment was very high (the proportion of juvenile plants was more than 50%). In consequence, in ruderal habitats, on average, plants were smaller, produced fewer panicles, and had a lower reproductive effort. The high percentage of bare ground, low pH and low functional group richness were the best explanatory variables associated to C. selloana invasion success. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In particular, the short co-evolutionary history of non-native plants with soil biota could confer unusual benefits or costs to hosts in the introduced range with consequences for invasion success. We used parallel pot and field studies to examine how soil biota (active or sterilized soil) and fungicide (addition or control) affected the growth and survival of the invasive, non-native tree, Sapium sebiferum, and three co-occurring native tree species Liquidambar styraciflua, Nyssa sylvatica, and Quercus nigra in the Big Thicket National Preserve in east Texas, USA.

It was also the only species to maintain high aboveground biomass and high aboveground nitrogen levels under those conditions. The high levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization found on Sapium compared to natives suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizae may be involved in this phenomenon. These results indicate that belowground soil organisms provide unusual positive benefits to the invader that are not experienced by native species.

By using its distribution in Austria, the invasion of this country is analysed in detail. The first reports of P. tomentosa in Austria were in the 1960s in Vienna. Since then, the number of sites has increased exponentially, with a total of 151 sites in 27 grid cells of the Floristic Mapping project of Austria. The number of sites per grid cell is strongly positively correlated with the minimum residence time in grid cell, which explains 86% of the deviance in the general linear model (GLM). The localities are confined to warm lowland areas (below 450 in altitude) and are concentrated in cities, with 90% of all localities recorded in cities with > 100,000 inhabitants. Paulownia tomentosa typically occurs in small populations of less then 10 individuals (83% of all records) and behaves as a pioneer species colonizing mainly disturbed urban habitats. Near-natural habitats, e.g. forest clearings and riparian shrubberies are rarely colonized. In extremely disturbed areas, the average number of vascular plant species is low (8.9 species), as is total plant cover (17%). As R tomentosa is currently mostly confined to synanthropic habitats in urban areas, the invasion is not yet a nature conservation issue. In the future, predicted climate change might allow P. tomentosa to spread beyond its current distribution. The habitat preference in the eastern USA indicates that further spread of P tomentosa in Central Europe might be accompanied by a switch to more natural habitats, e.g. forest clearings and forest margins. Thus, the future spread of this species should be closely monitored.",Web of Science,Paulownia tomentosa,Austria,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Here, we present information on a recently formed association between a native and an exotic bark beetle on their shared host, Pinus tabuliformis, in China.

For the highly successful invasive shrub Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius, we analysed a combination of nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites for eight native source regions and eight independent invasion events in four countries across three continents. We found that two exotic Australian populations came from different sources, one of which was derived from multiple native populations, as was an invasive sample from California. An invasive population from New Zealand appeared to be predominantly sourced from a single population, either from the native or exotic ranges. Four invasive populations from Chile were genetically differentiated from the native range samples analysed here and so their source of introduction could not be confirmed, but high levels of differentiation between the Chilean populations suggested a combination of different sources. This extensive global data set of replicated introductions also enabled tests of key theories of invasiveness in relation to genetic diversity. We conclude that invasive populations have similar levels of high genetic diversity to native ranges; levels of admixture may vary across invasive populations so admixture does not appear to have been an essential requirement for invasion; invasive and native populations exhibit similar level of genetic structure indicating similar gene flow dynamics for both types of populations. High levels of diversity and multiple source populations for invasive populations observed here discount founder effects or drift as likely explanations for previously observed seed size differences between ranges.

Pupfish body shape is correlated with environmental salinity: fish from saline habitats are characterized by slender body shapes, whereas fish from fresher, yet brackish springs are deep-bodied. In this study, lacustrine populations consisted of an approximately 30-year old population and several 1-year old populations, all introduced from the same source. The body shape divergence of the 30-year old population was significant and greater than any of the divergences of the 1-year old populations (which were for the most part not significant).

Although deliberate introductions and aquarium releases have likely been important, recreational boats may speed the spread of this snail into lakes. Prior research indicated boater access to be a significant predictor of invasion by C. chinensis and other invasive species in Wisconsin. To mimic the process of boater transport between lakes, I examined the tolerance of juvenile C. chinensis to air exposure in a series of field and laboratory experiments. Field experiments under mesic conditions indicated that this snail can survive exposure to air for at least 4 weeks. Larger juveniles were more resistant than smaller juveniles, an effect that was also observed in the laboratory during short-term (3-14 days) experiments. Tolerance of small juveniles to air exposure appeared to be unaffected by temperature, but was affected by humidity, with higher survival at 64% than 34% relative humidity (RH). Results from the current study suggest that C. chinensis is highly resistant to air exposure and could be readily transported by boats moving between lakes, particularly in cool mesic environments. Since juvenile C. chinensis are common around the roots of emergent macrophytes, hitchhiking with boats should be particularly common with boats or trailers infested with aquatic plants.

Previous studies of the survival, growth and reproduction of Pomacea canaliculata, a freshwater apple snail native to South America now widely spread in Asia, North America and Hawaii, have emphasized the use of fresh leaves as food. We compared the consumption and growth of P. canaliculata reared on fresh and decaying leaves of three species of macrophytes with contrasting content of phenolics (general plant defence chemicals) and nutrients. We conducted 1-day consumption assays using adult snails and a 1-month survival and growth experiment using snails of various sizes. Our results showed that the consumption, survival and growth of P. canaliculata were determined by plant nutrients and phenolics, rather than plant freshness. For Murdannia nudiflora, a species with low phenolic content, fresh leaves with high nitrogen content were more palatable and valuable for growth than decaying leaves with low nitrogen content. Survival was high and not different between the fresh and decaying leaf treatments. For Myriophyllum aquaticum, decaying leaves with moderate nitrogen and low phenolic contents were more palatable and valuable for snail survival and growth than fresh leaves with high nitrogen and high phenolic contents. For Polygonum barbatum, a species with low nitrogen and medium phenolic contents, both fresh and decaying leaves were unpalatable, resulted in low snail survivorship, and did not support snail growth. The results thus indicate that P. canaliculata can utilize both fresh and decaying leaves of adequate levels of nutrients and low levels of phenolics. This dietary flexibility may have contributed to its successful colonization of many types of freshwater wetlands in regions where high-quality fresh leaves are not available throughout the year.

Species invasions are often linked to reductions in biodiversity, and competitive superiority is often cited as the main reason for the success of an invasive species. Although invaded ecosystems are often examined, few have studied areas in which an invasive species has failed to successfully invade. 2. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a damaging pest and tospovirus vector that has invaded most of the world, and competitive superiority is considered one of the main reasons for this species' success. 3. However, a recent study demonstrated that competition between larval F. occidentalis and a native thrips species may be limiting F. occidentalis abundance in much of the eastern United States. Frankliniella occidentalis also has a limited abundance in central and southern Florida, which is dominated by the endemic F. bispinosa (Morgan). The potential for interspecific competition to limit F. occidentalis abundance in Florida was assessed. 4. The effects of competition between F. occidentalis and F. bispinosa on adult reproduction on a common host (Capsicum annuum L.) were quantified, using a response surface experimental design and a combination of linear and non-linear competition models. 5. Evidence of symmetric competition between these thrips species was found, but contrary to expectations, F. occidentalis reproduced more in dense interspecific populations than F. bispinosa. These results suggest that, unlike most of the eastern US, interspecific competition is not important in limiting F. occidentalis abundance in central and southern Florida. Â© 2011 The Authors.

Effects of habitat, genotype, and their interaction on invasive Rhododendron ponticum populations",journal,Biological Invasions,12,3,657,676,"The extent and nature of biological invasions are mainly influenced by either the genotype of the invading species, the suitability of the new habitat or by genotype-habitat interactions expressed in adaptations to the new environment. The relevance of these factors was assessed for the invasive evergreen shrub Rhododendron ponticum. Habitat characteristics of soil, climate and community properties were analysed in six native populations in both Georgia (Caucasus) and Spain and in six invasive ones in Ireland. Growth variables of rhododendron individuals and seedling occurrences in the field served as response variables. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment with rhododendron cuttings and determined survival of transplants in all countries. Due to low survival rates in Georgia and Spain, vegetative increase was only analysed for Ireland. The Irish sites benefited from significantly higher nutrient supply than the Spanish and Georgian sites. We found both strong positive correlations of nutrient supply and negative correlations of seasonal temperature amplitude with growth variables of shoots and seedling density. Origin, target site and interaction effects were significant in the survival of transplanted rhododendron individuals. The Irish site was more favorable for all genotypes, but the invasive genotypes did not perform better than the native ones. The total increase in shoot length of transplants in Ireland was highest in the Irish genotypes, which might suggest adaptation of the Irish populations to their new area. In conclusion, we found evidence for invasiveness of Irish Rhododendron ponticum populations, but only in the invaded habitat. Nonetheless, habitats in the new range also seem to be well suited to native Spanish populations, supporting the idea that invasibility of these new sites also contributes to rhododendron invasion success.

We hypothesized that there might be a trade-off between growth and sexual reproduction influenced by soil salinity and, that clonal integration would change this trade-off.

Both growth and sexual reproduction of S. alterniflora greatly decreased with increasing salinity. Clonal integration enhanced the survival, growth and sexual reproduction of daughter ramets experiencing salt stress, especially for young ramets, whereas the performance of mother ramets was reduced by clonal integration. Therefore, clonal integration did not affect performance of the whole clones. Contrary to expectations, there was no evidence for a trade-off between growth and sexual reproduction associated with salinity.

The tree was introduced separately to the east and west coasts of Florida more than 100 years ago from genetically distinct source populations. We conducted a common garden experiment to compare the early life-stage performance of hybrids versus their progenitors.

Hybrid seeds germinated at higher rates than eastern seeds. Over the 8-mo experiment, a greater proportion of hybrid seedlings survived than did western seedlings, and hybrids attained greater biomass than the western types.

Using field survey and laboratory experiments, we investigate parasitism as one of the factors mediating the interactions among invasive and native amphipods.

While Gammarus spp. Were widespread in rivers (one or both species present in 64% of sites), C. pseudogracilis had a restricted distribution (7% of sites) and always co-occurred with Gammarus spp. In contrast, Gammarus spp. were absent from all pond/reservoir sites, with C. pseudogracilis present in over 90%. While the negative association of C. pseudogracilis with Gammarus spp. undoubtedly results from factors such as physico-chemical tolerance and predation as C. pseudogracilis can be heavily predated by Gammarus spp., it was notable that C. pseudogracilis cooccurred with Gammarus spp. more frequently when the latter were parasitised. Laboratory experiments clearly showed that predation on C. pseudogracilis was greatly diminished when G. d. celticus was parasitised by P. mulleri and G. pulex by P. minutus. Our study provides evidence that parasitism, by mediating a key interspecific interaction, is one of an array of interacting factors that may have a role in driving patterns of exclusion and co-existence in natives and invaders. ??

Although previous theory and experiments have shown that plants are largely equivalent in their competitive effects on each other, competitive nonequivalence is hypothesized to occur in interactions between native and invasive species. Small overlap in resource use with unrelated native species, improved competitiveness, and production of novel allelochemicals are all believed to contribute to the invasiveness of introduced species. I tested all three assumptions in a common-garden experiment by examining the effect of plant origin and relatedness on competition intensity. Competitive interactions were explored within 12 triplets, each consisting of an invasive species, a native congeneric (or confamilial) species, and a native heterogeneric species that are likely to interact in the field. Plants were grown in pots alone or in pairs and in the absence or the presence of activated carbon to control for allelopathy. I found that competition intensity was not influenced by the relatedness or origin of competing neighbors. Although some exotic species may benefit from size advantages and species-specific effects in competitive interactions, none of the three mechanisms investigated is likely to be a principal driver of their invasiveness. ?? 2011 by The University of Chicago.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Illinois,,,,Garden,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,primary

We first conducted a field survey along several major roads crossing the Swiss Alps to study the distribution and growth performance of E. annuus along an altitudinal gradient. We then used amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess genetic variation within and among populations originating from different altitudes. To complement the molecular analyses, we compared the performance of genotypes with different distributions (i. e. local, occasional, widespread genotypes) in two common gardens at 400 m and 1,000 m a. s. l. Although E. annuus was seldom found above 1,000 m, plant performance in field populations did not decrease with increasing altitude. However, there was a significant decline in genotypic diversity within populations, and highland (711-1,100 m) populations were more differentiated (Gst = 0.55) than lowland (200-530 m) populations (Gst = 0.33). In the common garden experiment, local genotypes (i.e. those restricted to a single population) grew less vigorously than widespread genotypes, and were less likely to reproduce. We found no evidence for on-going adaptive changes and conclude that any selection acting on particular genotypes at the altitudinal limit is weak. This leads us to propose that the patterns in the distribution of genotypic diversity in E. annuus are governed by processes of occasional sexual reproduction, dispersal and extinction that are to a large extent independent of altitude. ?? 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Web of Science,Erigeron annuus,Switzerland,,Alps,,,Garden;Lab,terrestrial,Mountain,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

The aim of this study is to understand how non-native invasive species and native species are distributed along paved and unpaved roads, in a montaneous grassland ecosystem such as the Brazilian rupestrian fields. The two road surfaces provide differing gradients from their edges with respect to nutrients, soil chemical aspects and plant species diversity. High content of calcium at the roadside in the paved road resulted from the paving process, in which limestone gravel is used in one of the several paving phases. In these newly created habitats the toxicity of aluminum is drastically reduced and nutrient enriched, hence representing favorable sites from where non-native invasive species are capable to colonize and grow for undetermined period waiting the chance to invade the adjacent pristine habitats.

Artificial damage to leaves, mimicking herbivore attack, induced extra-floral nectar production on both adult trees and seedlings. This response was restricted to individual leaves rather than systemic. 3. Following EFN activation, trees were tended by the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile. Seedlings received a tenfold greater visitation rate from either L. humile or the native ant Plagiolepis pygmaea, which appears to displace the former.

Theoretically 1.9 million seeds could be dispersed on socks or 2.4 million seeds on trousers through a season but the actual numbers are likely to be much lower because of limited weed seed at the start of the walks. Because of differences in attachment and detachment rates, seeds from Acaena were more likely to be dispersed longer distances.

In this study, we used a non-native, highly invasive species of Poaceae (tropical signalgrass) to test the hypotheses that (i) tropical signalgrass success correlates negatively with success of most native species of macrophytes at fine spatial scales, but its success correlates positively or at random with natives at coarse spatial scales, and that (ii) tropical signalgrass is less associated with native species belonging to the family Poaceae than with species belonging to other families (Darwin's naturalization hypothesis). We used a dataset obtained at fine (0.25 m(2)) and coarse (ca. 1,000 m(2)) scales. The presence/absence of all species was recorded at both scales, and their biomass was also measured at the fine scale. We tested the association between tropical signalgrass biomass and individual native species with logistic regressions at the fine scale, and using the T-score index between tropical signalgrass and each native species at both scales. The likelihood of the occurrence of six species (submersed and free-floating) was negatively affected by tropical signalgrass biomass at the fine scale. T-scores showed that three species were less associated with tropical signalgrass than expected by chance, but 22 species co-occurred more than expected by chance at the coarse scale. Associations between species of Poaceae and tropical signalgrass were null at the fine scale, but were positive or null at the coarse scale.

These frugivores play an important role in long-distance seed dispersal, and may also affect germination success. The aim of this study was to determine whether generalist frugivores enhance or decrease seed germination of invasive alien species through pulp removal or seed coat abrasion, besides serving as dispersal agents. Fruits of four fleshy-fruited invasive alien plant species, namely Solanum mauritianum, Cinnamomum camphora, Lantana camara and Psidium guajava, were fed to three generalist avian frugivorous species, which have been observed feeding on these fruits in the wild. Seed retention time was recorded as this affects dispersal distance and the duration that seeds are exposed to the effects of the gut. Seeds removed from excreta, seeds from manually de-pulped fruit, and whole fruit were planted in soil trays housed in a greenhouse. Daily germination counts were done. Seed retention times differed significantly between bird species for all fruits, except those of C. camphora. However, all frugivores had a similar effect on the germination success of seeds of S. mauritianum, L. camara and P. guajava, showing that gut retention time was not important. Germination of seeds from manually de-pulped fruits did not differ from that of ingested seeds of all plant species, suggesting that seed coat abrasion was also not important. Pulp removal resulted in significantly higher germination rates, both in the two species with larger, multi-seeded fruit (S. mauritianum and P. guajava), and in the two species having single-seeded fruit with waxy exocarps (C. camphora and L. camara). Pulp removal also resulted in significantly earlier germination of L. camara and P. guajava seeds. Therefore, frugivores not only accelerate dispersal, but also greatly enhance seed germination of all fleshy-fruited invasive alien species in this study.",Web of Science,Solanum mauritianum;Cinnamomum camphora;Lantana camara;Psidium guajava,South Africa,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

Here, we determined its current distribution in Switzerland by sampling walnuts (Juglans regia L.) in ecologically and climatically distinct regions along potential invasion corridors. R. completa was found to be firmly established in most low altitude areas of Switzerland where walnuts thrive, but notably not a single parasitoid was recovered from any of the samples. Infested fruit was recovered in 42 of the 71 localities that were surveyed, with mean fruit infestation rate varying greatly among sites. The incidence of R. completa in Switzerland is closely related to meteorological mean spring temperature patterns influencing growing season length, but not to winter temperatures, reflecting survival potential during hibernation. Importantly, areas in which the fly is absent correspond with localities where the mean spring temperatures fall below 7 degrees C. Historical data records show that the natural cold barrier around the Alpine divide in the central Swiss Alps corresponding to such minimal temperatures has shrunk significantly from a width of more than 40 km before 1990 to around 20 km after 2000.

The recent invasion (during the past five years) of an alien whitefly, one member of Bemisia tabaci cryptic species complex, referred to as Mediterranean (herein referred to as Q-type) in Shandong Province, China, provides an ideal opportunity to study the changes in genetic variation between its home range in the Mediterranean region and its invasion range. Using both the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) and nuclear (microsatellite) DNA, we show that Q in Shandong likely originated in the western Mediterranean. We also found that the haplotype diversity was low compared with its presumed geographic origin, whereas microsatellite allele diversity showed no such decline. A key factor in invasions is the establishment of females and so bottleneck and founder events can lead to a very rapid and considerable loss of mitochondrial diversity. The lack of haplotype diversity in Shandong supports the interpretation that, at one or more points between the western Mediterranean and China, the invading Q lost haplotype diversity, most probably through the serial process of establishment and redistribution through trade in ornamental plants. However, the loss in haplotype diversity does not necessarily mean that nuclear allelic diversity should also decline. Provided females can mate freely with whichever males are available, allelic diversity can be maintained or even increased relative to the origin of the invader. Our findings may offer some explanation to the apparent paradox between the concept of reduced genetic variation limiting adaptation to new environments and the observed low diversity in successful invaders.",Web of Science,Bemisia tabaci,China,,Shandong Province,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,herbivore

This paper evaluates the importance of Japanese stiltgrass seed type (chasmogamous seeds, cleistogamous seeds, and seeds originating from forest-interior [F-I] plants) in terms of seed mass, viability, and germination across variable moisture regimes (three regions in West Virginia) and at two light levels (roadside and forest interior). Seeds From nine populations were sampled in three site types in 2005 and 2008 and stored at 5 C until testing in April 2009. Seeds were tested for viability using a dye test. Seeds were germinated under both constant and fluctuating day/night temperatures. Additional samples of CH and CL seeds collected in 2008 were tested for viability again in September 2010 for a measure of seed longevity. CL and F-I seeds were smaller in mass than CH seeds. Seeds from the drier sites were smaller in mass than seeds from the more mesic sites. CL seeds, followed by F-I seeds, were less viable than CH seeds in 2005 and 2008. CL and F-I seeds had lower germination rates than CH seeds for each site type in 2005, but germination rates of the seed types did not differ in 2008. Differences in seed longevity for 2008 seeds were lower for CL compared to CH seeds, but only in the drier sites. Japanese stiltgrass' longer-lived and larger CH seeds from the roadsides may ensure population survival over the long term. Younger CL and F-I seeds differ less from CH seeds in terms of germination than older seeds, which may help Japanese stiltgrass to maintain populations under relatively stable conditions in the short term.",Web of Science,Microstegium vimineum,USA,West Virginia,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances,primary

However, the mechanisms leading to its success have not been clearly elucidated. Although its success has been attributed to superior competitive ability, few competition studies have been performed with yellow starthistle to test this assertion. Yellow starthistle and wild oat (a dominant component of California annual grasslands) were grown in monocultures and mixtures to assess the strength of competitive interactions between them. For either species, intraspecific competition exerted a greater influence over mean plant weight than did interspecific competition. A companion study revealed temporal separation in the phenology of these plants, explaining the weak role of interspecific competition. Additional measurements of growth and soil moisture dynamics in large 270-cm-tall by 50-cm-diam polyvinyl chloride columns also showed a lack of interspecific competition and confirmed that water use patterns differed between these species, indicating niche partitioning. Wild oat reduced soil moisture to 5% but only to a depth of approximately 150 cm. Yellow starthistle depleted soil moisture to less than 5% throughout the column to a depth of at least 270 cm. These patterns were present when wild oat and yellow starthistle were grown individually or together in the columns, indicating that yellow starthistle had a greater impact on soil moisture and to greater depths. Yellow starthistle's invasion of grasslands in California does not appear to be due to superior competitive ability, but may be due to its ability to access deeper soil moisture.

We explore the survival of invertebrate dormant eggs in collected ships' ballast sediment over a 1-year period to determine relative invasion potential across taxa (i.e. rotifers, copepods, cladocerans and bryozoans) and different habitats (freshwater, marine). Location Canadian Atlantic and Pacific coasts and Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods During 2007 and 2008, 19 ballast samples were collected as a part of a larger study. The degradation rate of dormant eggs was assessed by enumerating dormant eggs and by conducting viability hatching experiments. Results Taxa examined included rotifers, copepods, anomopods, onychopods and bryozoans. Dormant eggs of rotifers degraded at the highest rate of all taxa examined, with no viable eggs remaining within 10 months. Copepods showed a less rapid degradation rate than rotifers. The degradation rate of anomopod dormant eggs was significantly slower than that of both rotifers and copepods. Onychopods and bryozoans did not visibly degrade at all over 12 months. Viability hatching experiments were successful for rotifers, copepods, and anomopods. Onychopods and bryozoans did not hatch during any of the three hatching trials. Main conclusions Dormancy is not equally beneficial to all invertebrate taxa. Our results indicate that dormant eggs of rotifers and copepods degrade at a rapid rate and may not pose high invasion risk. In contrast, the slow degradation rate of anomopod dormant eggs and the lack of degradation of onychopod and bryozoan dormant eggs could result in high invasion risk because of their accumulation in ballast tanks.

Results We found that nearly 80% of the mammals are strong invaders, but only half of the birds.

Methods To assess the role of random dispersal in long-term population dynamics of the studied species, we combined longitudinal data covering 50 years of the invasion of this plant from its very start, inferred from a series of aerial photographs of 60-ha plots, with data on population dynamics at a fine scale of 10-m(2) plots.

Using a combination of field and greenhouse approaches, we focus on the effects of H. lanatus on a common species in California coastal prairies, Erigeron glaucus, where the invasion is most intense. Key results : We found that H. lanatus had the strongest effects on E. glaucus via direct competition, but it also influenced the soil community in ways that feed back to negatively influence E. glaucus and other native species after H. lanatus removal. Conclusions : This approach provided evidence for multiple mechanisms contributing to negative effects of invasive species, and it identified when particular strategies were most likely to be important.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether admixture among multiple lineages, dispersal mechanisms, and high genetic diversity have contributed to the invasion of P. a. australis in the northeastern part of its range. Understanding mechanisms of the P. a. australis invasion will 1) contribute to a broader understanding of the factors that facilitate plant invasion, and 2) help us to develop effective management strategies for wetlands threatened by P. a. australis invasion. Methods : We used a population genetics approach incorporating nine microsatellite loci to study genetic diversity and population structure in relation to biogeography of introduced North American Phragmites a. australis stands in the northeastern continental region. Key Results : Phragmites a. australis is genetically diverse in the region studied here. Significant population structure exists, and population structure is likely influenced by both long-distance dispersal via major waterways, and short-distance dispersal overland. Different lineages sometimes colonize geographically proximate locations leading to opportunities for admixture. Clonal reproduction likely exaggerates geographical structure among some stands, although high genetic and clonal diversity within some stands implies that sexual reproduction occurs frequently in P. a. australis.

Spread of bittersweet before 1960 was primarily driven by high growth rates in developed and agricultural landscapes, while subsequent spread was mediated by expansion into deciduous and coniferous forests. Large, continuous patches of coniferous forests may substantially impede invasion. The success of C. orbiculatus and its potential mutualism with S. vulgaris suggest troubling predictions for the spread of other invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species across northeastern North America.",Web of Science,Celastrus orbiculatus,USA ; Canada,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling;Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation,,primary

It is difficult to forecast how climate change will influence community function or the probability of invasion as it alters multiple marine environmental parameters including rising water temperature, lower salinity and pH. In the present study, we correlate changes in environmental parameters to shifts in species composition in a subtidal community in Newcastle, NH through comparison of two, 3-year periods separated by 23 years (1979-1981 and 2003-2005). We observed concurrent shifts in climate related factors and in groups of organisms that dominate the marine community when comparing 1979-1981 to 2003-2005. The 1979-1981 community was dominated by perennial species (mussels and barnacles). In contrast, the 2003-2005 community was dominated by annual native and invasive tunicates (sea-squirts). We also observed a shift in the environmental factors that characterized both communities. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate characterized the 1979-1981 community while sea surface temperature, pH, and chlorophyll a characterized the 2003-2005 community. Elongated warmer water temperatures, through the fall and early winter months of the 2000s, extended the growing season of native organisms and facilitated local dominance of invasive species.

The dioecious tree Acer negundo, primarily invasive in Europe in wet habitats along riversides and in floodplains, has increased its abundance in dry habitats of industrial wasteland and ruderal sites during the last decades in Eastern Germany. We chose 21 invasive populations from wet and from dry habitats in the region of Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, to test whether Acer negundo exhibits a shift in life-history strategy during expansion into more stressful habitats. We analyzed variables of habitat quality (pH, soil moisture, exchangeable cations, total C and N content) and determined density, sex ratio and regeneration of the populations. In addition, we conducted germination experiments and greenhouse studies with seedlings in four different soil moisture environments. Local adaptation was studied in a reciprocal transplant experiment. We found habitat type differentiation with lower nutrient and water supply at the dry sites than at the moist sites and significant differences in the number of seedlings in the field. In accordance, seeds from moist habitats responded significantly faster to germination treatments. In the transplant experiment, leaf life span was significantly larger for populations originating from dry habitat types than from moist habitats. This observed shift in life history strategy during secondary invasion of A. negundo from traits of establishment and rapid growth towards traits connected with persistence might be counteracted by high gene flow among populations of the different habitat types. However, prolonged leaf life span at dry sites contributed remarkably to the invasion of less favourable habitats, and, thus, is a first indication of ongoing adaptation.",Web of Science,Acer negundo,Germany,,Eastern Germany,,,Field - Experimental;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

This is consistent with the notion of closed-canopy forests as communities relatively resistant to plant invasions. However, alien plants able to develop shade tolerance could be a threat to this unique forest. Phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation are two mechanisms enhancing invasiveness. Phenotypic plasticity can promote local adaptation by facilitating the establishment and persistence of invasive species in novel environments. We investigated the role of these processes in the recent colonization of Valdivian forest understory by the perennial alien herb Prunella vulgaris from nearby populations in open sites. Using reciprocal transplants, we found local adaptation between populations. Field data showed that the shade environment selected for taller plants and greater specific leaf areas. We found population differentiation and within-population genetic variation in both mean values and reaction norms to light variation of several ecophysiological traits in common gardens from seeds collected in sun and shade populations. The colonization of the forest resulted in a reduction of plastic responses to light variation, which is consistent with the occurrence of genetic assimilation and suggests that P. vulgaris individuals adapted to the shade have reduced probabilities to return to open sites.

Two other genotypes occurred in the western US (US 1a and US 3), but were restricted to populations near the presumed source of invasion in the middle Snake River, ID.

The fern flora spans a wide range of growth forms, with extraordinary diversity in morphology and plant size. Yet the potential factors underlying this diversity have remained enigmatic. Methods: We used a trait database generated from the most recent and comprehensive survey of Hawaiian ferns and lycophytes to test hypotheses of size-scaling and trait associations with environment and growth form as factors underlying this diversity. We also tested relationships among morphology, taxon abundance and distribution and identified key differences between native and alien taxa. Key results: Strong trait-trait relationships included geometric scaling of plant dimensions with a tendency for more divided fronds in larger ferns. Trait-environment relationships independent of size included more divided fronds at higher elevation, longer blades in shaded habitats, and fronds with shorter stipes and fewer pinnae in drier habitats. Growth forms differed in mean size with epiphytic and epipetric taxa smaller than terrestrial ferns. Plant size was independent of taxon abundance and distribution across islands, and native and alien ferns did not differ in mean size. Alien taxa were more abundant, especially at lower elevations, apparently due to human land use.

Results show that short-lived plants with a potential bud bank are i) more widely geographically distributed, ii) under-represented in natural habitats and weakly over-represented in habitats disturbed by human activities and iii) contrary to expectation, less numerous among neophytes than species without a potential bud bank.

Elodea canadensis is an invasive aquatic weed native to North America. Our aims were to reveal the evolutionary consequences of invasion to the population genetic structure of the presumably clonal E. canadensis in Finland and to test the hypothesis that the whole Finnish population originates from the first introduction of the species. We used ten polymorphic microsatellite markers to analyze the genetic characteristics of seven introduced E. canadensis populations in Finland. Despite the species' totally asexual mode of reproduction in Finland, two to five alleles per locus were detected in Finnish populations, and the expected heterozygosities varied between 0.19 and 0.37. The majority of variation was found within populations. Except for one, all pairwise values of population differentiation (FST) were significant, indicating restricted gene flow among the Finnish populations. In addition, a Bayesian analysis of population structure revealed the presence of regional population structuring. Genetic analyses indicate that E. canadensis could have been introduced to Finland multiple times. However, the amount of genetic variation and regional clustering detected could also be explained by post-establishment evolution, and based on this study it is not possible to exclude one introduction event followed by rapid evolution. We also tested the usability of the micro-satellite markers for native North American samples in order to compare the within-population genetic characteristics of introduced and native populations.

We indirectly tested the importance of N-fixation in the invasion of Genista monspessulana (French broom) in a California grassland by alleviating N and phosphorus (P) limitation to the grassland matrix. Grassland productivity was co-limited by N and P; N alone did not release the resident vegetation, and did not affect Genista performance. Genista was strongly limited by P: seedlings had more nodules, greater leaf N concentration, and higher growth and survival with P additions. When N was added with P, however, growth of the resident vegetation was 50-70% greater than with N or P alone, accompanied by decreases in Genista performance.

Most of this research, however, has been conducted on a single trophic level; i.e. it has primarily looked at how the diversity of native competitors may influence invasion success. Less attention has been paid to understanding how native prey diversity may influence the invasion success of exotic predators and whether such biotic factors are scale-dependent. We used a hierarchical spatial survey of 17 stream communities to test whether native prey diversity, along with native prey biomass, algal resource abundance and annual stream discharge, influenced the abundance of an exotic crayfish predator, and whether the importance of these factors were scale-dependent. We used a hierarchical generalized linear model to evaluate the influence of these community and stream characteristics on exotic crayfish abundance at both the transect scale (1 m(2)) and the stream scale (400 m(2)). Our results indicated that at the stream scale, high stream discharge significantly limited invader abundance. However, at the smaller transect scale, native prey biomass was a significant driver of invasion success and positively correlated with invader abundance. We suggest that our results add to the emerging pattern that abiotic processes are stronger determinants of invasion success at large spatial scales, whereas biotic processes become more important with decreasing spatial scale.

In a comparison of sea urchin gut contents to algal community composition, strong preferences were exhibited, leading to no relationship between consumption and availability. Both C. racemosa and L. lallemandi were abundant in algal assemblages (> 60% occurrence), but C. racemosa (20% of diet) was consumed more than L. lallemandi (3.5%). Experimental enclosures of sea urchins (12 sea urchins * m(-2)) were carried out in locations where L. lallemandii was already established and C. racemosa was rare (new invasion) or abundant (established invasion). C. racemosa was negatively affected by sea urchins only when it was rare, and no effect was detected when the alga was already abundant. Results for L. lallemandi were exactly opposite: urchins limited seasonal increases in L. lallemandi in highly-invaded areas. Because of the small amount of direct consumption of L. lallemandi, its decrease in abundance may be related to the grazing of native algae where L. lallemandii is attached. Overall, our results show that high densities of native herbivores may reduce invasive algae at low densities, due to a combination of direct and indirect effects, but it has no significant effect in highly-invaded areas.",Web of Science,Lophocladia lallemandii;Caulerpa racemosa,Spain, Balearic Islands,Cabrera Archipelago,,,Field - Observational,marine,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,herbivore

The exotic freshwater amphipod (Gammarus roeseli) has now largely colonized Western Europe where it is often found in sympatry with a native species (Gammarus pulex). Here we documented interspecific differences in drifting behaviour that might have favored the invader's success through differential predation. Benthic and drifting amphipods were sampled three times at the same site to compare the proportion of each species within and between sample types (benthos or drift) across time. Compared with the benthos, where the invader (G. roeseli) was significantly less abundant than the native (G. pulex), G. roeseli was proportionally overrepresented in the drift but displayed a very different drifting pattern. While G. pulex drift rates remained roughly constant over a 24 h period, G. roeseli showed a marked diel periodicity with low diurnal and high nocturnal drift rates. Such drifting behaviour could procure this species with a competitive advantage regarding predation as most drift feeding fish are diurnal.

To determine if the mechanisms for this displacement are associated with different survival and growth, we kept mussels in flow-through tanks for 289 days with two temperature regimes that mimicked the natural surface water (littoral zone) and hypolimnion conditions of Lake Erie. For the littoral zone regime, we used water directly from the surface of Lake Erie (range 4-25A degrees C, average 11.9 +/- A 0.6A degrees C).

For each of these temperature regimes, we used three replicate tanks with only zebra mussels present and three replicate tanks with only quagga mussels (150 ind./tank each), and three replicate tanks with both species (75 ind./tank of each species). Quagga mussels had higher survivorship and grew more than zebra mussels in all treatments. For both species, the size of the mussel entering the winter was critical for survivorship. Larger mussels had a higher survival over the winter in all treatments. For both species, there was a survivorship and growth tradeoff. In the warmer littoral zone treatment both species had higher growth, but lower survival than in the colder profundal zone treatment. Surprisingly, although quagga mussels outperformed zebra mussels, zebra mussel survivorship was better when they were faced with competition by quagga mussels than with just intraspecific competition. In addition, quagga mussels suffered size-specific mortality during the growing season only when facing interspecific competition with zebra mussels.

The exotic phloem-feeding emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, has killed tens of millions of North American ash trees (Fraxinus) since its first detection in the U. S. A. in 2002. Ash trees are killed by larval feeding in the cambial region, which disrupts translocation of photosynthates and nutrients. 2. We observed that EAB larvae feed predominantly downwards in naturally grown green ash trees, a behaviour confirmed in greenhouse-grown black ash seedlings. Furthermore, biomass of larvae feeding downwards was greater than that for larvae feeding upwards. 3. We sought to determine the relative importance of four selection forces (i.e. gravity, moisture content, plant defence, and nutrition) in driving this downward feeding behaviour in this study. The gravity and plant defence (i.e. polyphenols) hypotheses were ruled out because even when seedlings were grown upside down, more EAB larvae moved upwards (towards the root area), and phloem tissue below the feeding site contained higher concentrations of defensive compounds than that above the feeding site. 4. The moisture content hypothesis was supported as phloem moisture above the feeding site decreased to levels reducing survivorship and biomass but was unaffected below. The nutrition hypothesis was also supported as the levels of 11 amino acids (mostly essential amino acids) below the feeding site were greater than those above. Furthermore, growth of larvae reared on an artificial diet deficient in protein and amino acids was worse than larvae reared in diet with complete ingredient or diet deficient in either protein or amino acids. 5.

However, there is a lack of information about how this tolerance influences invasiveness of exotic species in ecosystems with seasonal drought. To address this question for Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTE) of the Iberian Peninsula, we carried out an experiment with fifteen phylogenetically related species (8 invasive and 7 native, Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don, Schinus molle Linn., Elaeagnus angustifolia L. Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Acacia melanoxylon R. Br., Gleditsia triacanthos L. Pistacia terebinthus L., Rhamnus alaternus L., Anagyris foetid L, Colutea arborescens L., Oenothera biennis L., Epilobium hirsutum L. Achille filipendulina Lam. and Achillea millefolium L). Seedlings were grown and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)) was measured at two water availabilities (well-watered and with water stress). PSII thermal tolerance measurements were related to specific leaf area (SLA), which varied significantly across the study species, and to the mean potential evapotranspiration (PET) of the month with the lowest precipitation in the native areas of both groups and in the invaded area of the Iberian Peninsula. Additionally, PSII thermal tolerance measurements under water stress were phylogenetically explored. Invasive and native species neither differed in SLA nor in their thermal tolerance under well-watered conditions. For well-watered plants. SLA was significantly and positively related to PSII thermal tolerance when all species were explored together regardless of their invasive nature. However, this relationship did not persist under water stress and invasive species had higher plastic responses than Mediterranean natives resulting in higher leaf temperatures. Higher PSII thermal tolerance could explain invasiveness because it allows for longer periods of carbon acquisition under water stress. In fact, PSII thermal tolerance was positively related to the PET of the invaded and native areas of the Iberian Peninsula. PSII thermal tolerance was not related to PET at the native range of the invasive species, suggesting that successful invasive species were plastic enough to cope with novel dry conditions of the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, our phylogenetic results indicate that future scenarios of increased aridity in MTE associated to climate change will filter invasion success by taxonomic identity.

However other factors like host plant might contribute to spatial patterns in size as well, particularly for polyphagous insects. Here elevation patterns for trait size and shape in two leafminer species are examined, Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) and L. sativae Blanchard, along a tropical elevation gradient in Java, Indonesia. Adult leafminers were trapped from different locations in the mountainous area of Dieng in the province of Central Java. To separate environmental versus genetic effects, L. huidobrensis originating from 1378 m and 2129 m ASL were reared in the laboratory for five generations. Size variation along the elevation gradient was only found in L. huidobrensis and this followed expectations based on the temperature-size rule. There were also complex changes in wing shape along the gradient. Morphological differences were influenced by genetic and environmental effects.

The feeding behavior of G. ficicola and G. psidii was investigated on their respective host plants, Ficus benjamina (Moraceae) and Psidium guajava (Myrtaceae), using the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG). Fifteen females of each aphid species were monitored during 24h using a DC-EPG GIGA-4 monitor. The time spent in phloem phase (waveforms El and E2) was 13.6% of the total recording time for G. ficicola and 0.8% for G. psidii. The average time in the pathway phase (waveforms C and pd) represented 50% of the total time for both species. Aphids spent more time in non-penetration and stylet pathway activities than in the phloem phase or actual feeding. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the two species formed different groups in relation to EPG parameters, despite some overlapping. The probing patterns with multiple penetrations of short duration in the sieve elements for both species may indicate apparent unsuitability for sustained feeding on their respective host plants.

The role of nutrients, species identity, species influence in determining the outcome of competition between the species was estimated using the Relative Growth Rate Difference (RGRD) model. The two species differed in their response to nutrient loading. The native L minor responded indifferently to nutrient loading. The species Relative Growth Rate (RGR) was 0.10 d(-1), 0.11 d(-1) and 0.09 d(-1) in high, medium and low nutrients, respectively. On the other hand, the invasive L. minuta responded opportunistically to high nutrient availability and had an RGR of 0.13 d(-1), 0.10 d(-1) and 0.08 d(-1) in high, medium and low nutrients, respectively. As a result, the invasive species was dominant in high nutrient availability but lost to the native species at low nutrient availability. The invader formed approximately 60% and less than 50% of the stand final total dry biomass in high and low nutrient availability, respectively. Species RGR were reduced by both intra- and interspecific competition but intraspecific effects were stronger than interspecific effects. On the overall, the species significantly differed in their constant RGR. These differences in RGR between the species (species identity) and the differential response to nutrient loading were the main determinant of change in final biomass composition of these species in mixture. Species influence (competition) only had a small influence on the outcome of competition between the species. The observed species response to nutrient loading could be targeted in management of the invasive species. Lowering nutrients can be proposed to reduce the impact of the invasive L. minuta.

B. tabaci is composed of dozens of morphologically indistinguishable biotypes and its taxonomic status is still controversial. This phloem-feeder harbours the primary symbiont Portiera aleyrodidarum and potentially six secondary symbionts: Cardinium, Arsenophonus, Hamiltonella, Rickettsia, Wolbachia and Fritschea. In the southwest Indian Ocean, La Reunion hosts two biotypes of this species: B (invasive) and Ms (indigenous). A multiplex PCR was developed to study the symbiont community of B. tabaci on La Reunion. Symbiont community prevalence and composition, host mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity, as well as host plant and localization, were described on field populations of La Reunion for B and Ms B. tabaci biotypes and their hybrids. A clear association between symbiotypes and biotypes was shown. Cardinium, Arsenophonus and Rickettsia were found in the Ms biotype (73.6%, 64.2% and 3.3%, respectively). Hamiltonella (exclusively) and Rickettsia were found in the B biotype (78% and 91.2%, respectively). Hybrids harboured all symbiotypes found in Ms and B populations, but with a higher prevalence of Ms symbiotypes than expected under random hybridization. An unexpected majority was Cardinium mono-infected (65.6%), and a striking minority (9%) harboured Cardinium/Arsenophonus. In the hybrids only, genetic diversity was linked to symbiotype. Among the hybrids, significant links were found between symbiotypes and: (i) mitochondrial COI sequences, i.e. maternal origin; and (ii) alleles of nuclear microsatellite loci, specific to either Ms or B parental biotype.

Using recent large databases from observational studies, we find robust evidence that assemblage of plant community types from few phylogenetic lineages (in plots without aliens) corresponds to higher receptiveness to aliens. Establishment of aliens in phylogenetically poor communities corresponds to increased phylogenetic dispersion of recipient communities and to coexistence with rather than replacement of natives. This coexistence between natives and distantly related aliens in recipient communities of low phylogenetic dispersion may reflect patterns of trait assembly. In communities without aliens, low phylogenetic dispersion corresponds to increased dispersion of most traits, and establishment of aliens corresponds to increased trait concentration. We conclude that if quantified across the tree of life, high biodiversity correlates with decreasing receptiveness to aliens.

Among the aquatic species non-native to France, a high proportion of these species are considered to be salt-tolerant. To verify this assumption, we compared the salinity tolerance of 18 native and non-native species in France in order to determine whether the introduced non-native species are more salt-tolerant than the native ones. Contrary to our expectations, our study shows that both native and non-native macroinvertebrate species from the same taxonomic group which had originated from within Eurasia had very similar salinity tolerance. Our results show that species originate from outside Eurasia (introduced by the ballast or drinking water on ships) were more salt tolerant than native from France and non-native species originated from Eurasia. Thus, derivation of the acute test of the salinity tolerance in native ranges may give good indications of their potential ability to survive during the translocation by shipping from the area of origin to another area.

Progenies of tropical snails collected from Luzon and Mindanao, the Philippines, which had never experienced cold weather revealed the same response as Japanese snails to cold stress: enhancement of cold hardiness after cold acclimation. Cold-tolerant snails from tropical populations also attained better survivorship under desiccation conditions. Thus, linkage of tolerance between cold weather and desiccation appears to be a general feature of P. canaliculata.

First, we consider recent climatic trends of the Antarctic region, and its potential influence on the establishment, distribution and abundance of alien insects, using as examples one fly and one beetle species. Second, we consider to what extent limited gene pools may restrict alien species' colonisations. Finally, we consider the vulnerability of native communities to aliens using the examples of one beetle, one fly, and five aphid species taking into consideration their additional impact as plant virus vectors.

Genetic structure, genotype assignment and genetic diversity were compared among 1262 round gobies from 20 river and four lake sites in three Great Lakes tributaries. Our results indicate that a combination of short-distance diffusion and long-distance dispersal, collectively referred to as 'stratified dispersal', is facilitating river colonization. Colonization proceeded upstream yearly (approximately 500 m/year; 2005-2009) in one of two temporal replicates while genetic structure was temporally stable. Contiguous dispersal from the lake was observed in all three rivers with a substantial portion of river fish (7.3%) identified as migrants. Genotype assignment indicated a separate introduction occurred upstream of the invasion front in one river.

This measure is informative on how widespread exotics are, however, it does not inform on their local dominance, which is crucial for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The aim of the present study is to determine if regional frequency of occurrence of exotic plant species indeed is indicative of their local dominance. We also determined which plant traits and other factors predict regional and local frequencies best. Location The Netherlands. Methods We used information on exotic plant species established in The Netherlands and compared traits relating to their frequency of occurrence regionally (the entire country) and their frequency of dominance locally (in 1-100 m2 quadrats). We created minimal adequate models with factors explaining regional frequency and frequency of local dominance of 111 exotic plant species in The Netherlands. Results The model that used plant traits to explain regional frequency of exotic plant species differed from the models that best explained their frequency of local dominance. Regionally, the factors that correlated with frequency were: life form, height, polyploidy, length of flowering season, residence time, human use and origin. The factors that correlated to frequency of local dominance were lateral vegetative spread and residence time. Main conclusions We conclude that plant traits relating to the regional frequency of exotic plant species differ from those that relate to their frequency of local dominance. The implication of our results is that predictive studies on plant invasiveness based on regional frequencies may not be indicative of the local impacts.

Methods We drew upon extensive field data from the US Forest Service and the US Geological Survey to calculate spread rate from 2003 to 2008 and to parameterize logistic regression models estimating habitat quality for Chinese tallow within individual habitat cells. We applied the regression analyses to represent population spread rate as a function of habitat quality, integrated this function into a logistic model representing local spread, and coupled this model with a dispersal model based on a lognormal kernel within the simulation framework. We simulated invasions beginning in 2003 based on several different dispersal velocities and compared the resulting spatial patterns to those observed in 2008 using cross Mantel's tests. We then used the best dispersal velocity to predict range expansion to the year 2023. Results Chinese tallow invasion is more likely in low and flat areas adjacent to water bodies and roads, and less likely in mature forest stands and in pine plantations where artificial regeneration by planting seedlings is used.

Verdc.,journal,HYDROBIOLOGIA,665,1,93,105,"Nuisance growth of Myriophyllum aquaticum has often been attributed to high amounts of nutrients. The uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments and their allocation have been documented in both natural and laboratory populations. However, nutrient loading to surface water is increasingly becoming an important issue for water quality standards. Aquatic macrophytes that develop adventitious roots may be able to survive through the uptake of water column nutrients. Our objectives for this study were to assess M. aquaticum growth when combinations of nitrogen and phosphorus were added to the water column. Mesocosm experiments were conducted where nitrogen (1.8, 0.8, and 0.4 mg l(-1); high, medium, and low) and phosphorus (0.09, 0.03, 0.01 mg l(-1); high, medium, and low) concentrations were paired and added to the water column. After 12 weeks, the combination of 1.80:0.01 N:P resulted in greater (P < 0.01) total biomass and greater biomass for all plant tissues. Total biomass at the 1.80:0.01 N:P combination was 53% greater than biomass at all other combinations. The yield response of M. aquaticum was a quadratic function of tissue nutrient content. Yield was positively (r (2) = 0.82) related to increasing nitrogen content, whereas a negative (r (2) = 0.89) relationship was determined for increasing phosphorus content. We propose the negative relationship is due to increased nutrient competition and shading by algae resulting in reduced M. aquaticum growth. Tissue nutrient content indicated that critical concentrations (1.8% nitrogen and 0.2% phosphorus) for growth were not attained except for nitrogen in plants grown in the 1.80:0.01 N:P combination. These data provide further evidence that M. aquaticum requires high levels of nitrogen to achieve nuisance growth.

Biological communities are responding to global climate change through poleward shifts in distribution, and changes in abundance and phenology of both native and non-native species. An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events is predicted with global climate change. Much is known about mortality events of marine organisms in relation to warm thermal stress with relatively little known about cold thermal stress, particularly in the tropics. Intertidal species are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in aerial conditions and many are considered indicators of climate change. Perna viridis is a recent invader to the United States where it fouls hard substrates and soft sediment habitats. During winter 2007/08, a mortality event was observed for P. viridis across Tampa Bay, Florida. This mortality event coincided with extreme weather conditions when air temperatures dropped below 2 degrees C for a period of 6 h during low water. The minimum air temperature recorded was 0.53 degrees C. During this period water temperature remained relatively constant (similar to 20 degrees C). We provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that thermal stress relating to exposure to cold air temperatures during emersion was the primary factor underpinning the mortality event. Similar mortality events occurred in 2009 and 2010, also coinciding with prolonged exposure to low air temperatures. In the short term, weather may be responsible for the temporary trimming back of populations at the edge of their geographic range but in the longer-term, it is expected that climate warming will trigger the poleward movement of both native and non-native species potentially facilitating biotic homogenisation of marine communities. The challenge now is to devise adaptive management strategies in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts to native biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using eight microsatellite loci and a common garden approach, we compared Q(ST) and F(ST) among ten populations of an invasive species Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) in France. In a common garden study with varying water and nutrient levels, we measured Q(ST) for five traits (height, total biomass, reproductive allocation, above- to belowground biomass ratio, and days to flowering). Although low F(ST) indicated weak genetic structure and strong gene flow among populations, we found significant diversifying selection (Q(ST) > F(ST)) for reproductive allocation that may be closely related to fitness. It suggests that abiotic conditions may have exerted selection pressure on A. artemisiifolia populations to differentiate adaptively, such that populations at higher altitude or latitude evolved greater reproductive allocation. As previous studies indicate multiple introductions from various source populations of A. artemisiifolia in North America, our results suggest that the admixture of introduced populations may have increased genetic diversity and additive genetic variance, and in turn, promoted the rapid evolution and adaptation of this invasive species.",Web of Science,Ambrosia artemisiifolia; ,France,,,,,Garden,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

Furthermore, we found that phenology had significant effects on beetle predation on fruits and seeds, with fruits developed from early flowers having higher levels of beetle attacks than ones developed from later flowers in the season. Finally, seeds and fruits attacked by beetles were more likely to be attacked by a Fusarium fungus, probably due to coinfestation of the two predators.

Many studies have focused on exotic invasive species. In general, exotic invasive plants have higher resource capture ability and utilization capacity, and lower leaf construction cost (CC) compared to noninvasive plants. However, the physiological mechanisms that determine the invasiveness of native plants are poorly understood. We hypothesized that native invaders, like exotic invaders, may have higher resource capture ability and utilization efficiency compared to native noninvaders. To test this hypothesis, ecophysiological traits including light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)), specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic nitrogen use-efficiency (PNUE), photosynthetic energy-use efficiency (PEUE), and mass-based and area-based leaf construction cost (CC(mass) and CC(area)) were measured.

Herbivores often establish a dual relationship with plants: antagonist, through herbivory, and mutualist, through seed dispersal. By consuming plants, herbivores may disperse large amounts of seeds, and can facilitate the spread of alien plants. However, seed dispersal of alien plants by herbivores has been largely uninvestigated. I studied factors associated with dispersal of alien and native seeds by the three most important vertebrate herbivores in SW Australia: emus (Dromaius novaehollandia), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Overall frequencies of alien and native seeds dispersed by these herbivores were determined by differences among them in (1) the plant groups they predominantly disperse, that differed in frequencies of aliens versus natives, and (2) the predominant dispersal of aliens or natives within those plant groups. Emus and kangaroos (natives) tended to disperse predominantly alien seeds within plant groups (defined by life forms, dispersal syndromes, and diaspore size), whereas rabbits (alien) tended to disperse predominantly natives. This agrees with the hypothesis that herbivores will use predominantly plants that have evolved in different areas, because of less effective defences against new enemies. Overall frequencies were consistent with this pattern in kangaroos and rabbits, but not in emus. Kangaroos dispersed mostly plant groups that were mainly aliens (herbaceous species and small and medium sized dispersal units and seeds), which together with their predominant use of aliens over natives within groups resulted in the highest overall frequency of alien seeds (73%). Rabbits were similar to kangaroos in the type of plants dispersed, but their predominant use of natives over aliens within groups contributed to an overall predominance of native seeds in their pellets (88%). Emus dispersed mostly plant groups that were mainly natives (e.g. woody species with big diaspores), resulting in low overall frequency of alien seeds (11%), despite their predominant use of aliens over natives within plant groups. Thus, the within-groups trend pointed to a facilitative role of native herbivores of plant invasions through seed dispersal, but was obscured by the different use by herbivores of plant groups with different frequency of aliens.",Web of Science,Many,Australia,,,,,,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,,,primary

To determine the importance of reproductive success and pollination biology for an invasive thistle, Cirsium vulgare, we compared it in its invaded range to five, co-occurring native Cirsium species that range from rare to common. Native study species include C. fontinale var. fontinale, C. andrewsii, C. brevistylum, C. occidentale, and C. quercetorum. We compared all species' reproductive success, insect visitation rate and composition, autonomous self-pollination, and level of pollen limitation in multiple populations. Species differed in their reproductive success; the invasive C. vulgare produced more flower heads per plant than most native species. C. vulgare attracted more visitors than its congeners. In addition, reproductive success and insect visitation significantly varied between populations within species, mainly due to aphid infestation in one population of C. occidentale. Unlike the rare species (C. fontinale and andrewsii), C. vulgare did not require a pollinator for high-levels of seed production. The remaining native species set fewer seeds than C. vulgare without a pollinator. However, differences in insect visitation and autonomous self-pollination did not lead to differences in pollen limitation across species or between populations. This result suggests that factors other than pollination biology determine the difference in reproductive success of these species. However, high levels of autonomous self-pollination and generalist insect visitation may allow the invasive C. vulgare to easily establish new populations from low numbers of propagules. Our study provides one contrast that should build towards a larger comparative analysis to examine general patterns in the relationship between reproductive success, pollination biology, rare and invasive species, and our ability to predict biological invasions in introduced species.",Web of Science,Cirsium vulgare,USA,California,,,,,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,,,primary

The effects of pollinator change on plant reproduction were surveyed on these contrasting island groups. The total visitation rates and the number of interacting visitor groups on main islands were 63% and 30% lower than that on satellite islands, respectively. On the main islands, the honeybees preferred to visit alien flowers, whereas the dominant endemic bees on satellite islands tended to visit native flowers more frequently than alien flowers. These results suggest that alien anoles destroy the endemic pollination system and caused shift to alien mutualism. On the main islands, the natural fruit set of alien plants was significantly higher than that of native plants. In addition, the natural fruit set was positively correlated with the visitation rate of honeybees. Pollen limitation was observed in 53.3% of endemic species but only 16.7% of alien species.

Biological invasions, still occurring worldwide at an alarming rate, are widely acknowledged as threats to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. In addition to introducing disease, biological invasions have also been linked to sudden increases in the incidence or severity of previously existing diseases. We review and illustrate the potential direct and indirect impacts of introduced species on the dynamics of endemic parasites in freshwater ecosystems. 2. Introduced species may trigger and sustain disease emergence by acting as competent hosts for endemic parasites in which infection is amplified and then 'spilled back' to native hosts. In contrast, if introduced species are not suitable hosts for endemic parasites but become infected anyway, they may act as sinks for parasites and thus dilute disease risk for native hosts. 3. Another mechanism by which introduced species can influence endemic parasitic diseases is by altering the relative abundance of one of the parasite's hosts in ways that could either enhance or reduce disease transmission to other native hosts in the parasite's life cycle. 4. Introduced species may also alter disease incidence and severity in native hosts through trait-mediated indirect effects. For example, the introduced species could change the exposure or susceptibility of native hosts to infection by causing alterations in their behaviour or immunocompetence. Also, by directly changing physicochemical conditions and modifying environmental stressors introduced species may indirectly affect native host exposure and/or resistance to disease. 5. A survey of parasites infecting introduced freshwater fish in four distinct geographical areas revealed that use of non-indigenous hosts by endemic parasites is widespread, mostly involving parasites transmitted via the food chain. 6. We conclude by presenting a framework, based on risk assessment, for the prediction and possible mitigation of the impact of introduced species on endemic diseases and by calling for greater recognition of the potential role of invasive species as triggers of endemic disease emergence.",Web of Science,Many,,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling;Statistical/Meta-analysis,lentic;lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,herbivore;predator

Exotic plant species have become increasingly prominent features of ecological landscapes throughout the world, and their interactions with native and exotic taxa in these novel environments may play critical roles in mediating the dynamics of such invasions. 2. Here, we summarize results from comparative and experimental studies that explore the effects of two factors - herbivory and facilitation - on the performance and distribution of an invasive South African grass, Ehrharta calycina, in a coastal foredune system in northern California, USA. 3. Using a 2-year exclosure experiment, we show that a native herbivore, black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), significantly reduced the height, shoot production, fecundity and above-ground biomass of this exotic grass. 4. Data from two comparative studies and a neighbour-removal experiment revealed that Ehrharta frequently escaped herbivores by associating with three neighbouring plant species an exotic perennial grass, Ammophila arenaria, an exotic perennial succulent, Carpobrotus edulis, and a native perennial shrub, Baccharis pilularis. Ehrharta growing in association with neighbours was taller, had fewer grazed shoots, produced greater numbers of spikelets and had greater above-ground biomass than unassociated individuals. Furthermore, removing neighbours generally eliminated these benefits in 7 months, although effects differed among neighbour species. 5. An additional neighbour-removal experiment conducted in the absence of jackrabbits indicated that neighbour removals did not have significant impacts on Ehrharta height, shoot production, spikelet production or above-ground dry biomass. These results suggest that the primary means by which Ehrharta benefits from neighbouring plants is protection from herbivores - either because they are less apparent to herbivores or less accessible and that Ehrharta likely incurred minimal costs from associating with neighbours. 6. Ehrharta was more frequently associated with neighbours than expected due to chance, and less frequently found in open dune habitat. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of herbivory and facilitation have been sufficiently strong to shape the local distribution of this invader in the landscape. 7.

Efforts to explain variability in invasion speed and impact by searching for combinations of ecological conditions and species traits associated with invasions have met with mixed success. We use a simulation model that integrates insights from life-history theory, animal personalities, network theory, and spatial ecology to derive a new mechanism for explaining variation in animal invasion success. We show that spread occurs most rapidly when (1) a species includes a mix of life-history or personality types that differ in density-dependent performance and dispersal tendencies, (2) the differences between types are of intermediate magnitude, and (3) patch connections are intermediate in number and widely spread. Within-species polymorphism in phenotype (e.g., life-history strategies or personality), a feature not included in previous models, is important for overcoming the fact that different traits are associated with success in different stages of the invasion process. Polymorphism in sociability (a personality type) increases the speed of the invasion front, since asocial individuals colonize empty patches and facilitate the local growth of social types that, in turn, induce faster dispersal by asocials at the invasion edge.

Location New York State, USA. Methods We developed a two-stage model for the spread of C. pengoi. First, we developed a stochastic gravity model for dispersal based on surveys of recreational boat traffic in New York State as a proxy for propagule pressure. We then modelled the probability of establishment based on predicted levels of propagule pressure and measures of lakes' physicochemistry. In addition, we used Monte Carlo simulations based on the gravity model to propagate variability in boater traffic through the establishment model to assess how uncertainty in dispersal influenced predictions of spread. Results The amount recreationalists were willing to spend, lake area and population size of the city nearest to the destination lake were significant factors affecting boater traffic.

We hypothesized that invasion is limited by lack of propagules and the low soil nutrient levels of this old, infertile landscape, but that fire and/or fragmentation disrupt these limits. We tested the effects of three factors on establishment and abundance of alien annuals: +/- fire, +/- post-fire seeding with the locally invasive Avena barbata (propagule availability) and three landscape contexts. The three landscape contexts, exploring site limitations, were reserve interiors, perimeter edges adjacent to agricultural land and internal reserve roadside edges. Our first hypothesis was supported: Avena establishment was consistently greater in seeded plots, but away from perimeter edges, growth was poor. Our second hypothesis was supported only for perimeter edges: neither fire nor fragmentation by interior roads enhanced invasive plant establishment or biomass. At perimeter edges, invasive plant biomass was significantly greater. This was associated with higher propagule availability and elevated soil nutrient levels but was not enhanced by fire.

Genetic analysis has proven useful in understanding the invasion history and dynamics of colonizing NIS and identifying their source population(s). Here we investigated sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer region of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species considered one of the most invasive globally. We surveyed four populations from the native distribution range along the Atlantic coasts of the United States and South America, as well as six populations in the introduced range from the Black, Azov, Caspian and Baltic seas. Allelic and nucleotide diversity of introduced populations were comparable to those of native populations from which they were likely drawn. Introduced populations typically exhibited lower genetic differentiation (F (ST) = -0.014-0.421) than native populations (F (ST) = 0.324-0.688). Population genetic analyses supported the invasion of Eurasia from at least two different pathways, the first from the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Tampa Bay) to the Black Sea and thence to the Caspian Sea, the second from the northern part of the native distribution range (e.g., Narragansett Bay) to the Baltic Sea.

One such procedure is grafting, in which individuals are propagated for commercial sale by joining a clone of a desired cultivar (the scion) with rootstock obtained from a different individual. If the rootstock can sprout and flower, it can potentially cross-pollinate the scion, leading to fruit production in a self-incompatible species. The effect of grafting on invasion success was examined in the Callery pear, Pyrus calleryana, one of the most popular landscaping trees in the United States. Using nine microsatellite markers, scion and rootstock were genotyped for 57 cultivated trees to characterize rootstock genotypes and the rootstock gene pool. Invasive populations were then sampled to determine if rootstock genotypes have contributed to their formation. In no case were scion and rootstock genotypes identical for any given cultivated tree and rootstock genotypes were genetically variable, although some cloned rootstock genotypes were detected. Rootstock genotypes were also observed in invasive populations, with up to 17% of wild individuals having at least one rootstock parent. These results indicate that rootstock can contribute to the formation of invasive populations of the Callery pear through cross-pollination with other available genotypes. Future investigations of woody ornamentals propagated by grafting should consider this horticultural practice as a potential contributor to invasiveness. Furthermore, plant breeders are encouraged to assess the ability of rootstock to sprout as well as its cross-compatibility with the scion or other cultivar genotypes growing nearby.",Web of Science,Pyrus calleryana,USA,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Infections were associated with rapid die-offs of natural populations of amphipods, especially the exotic E. ischnus. Analysis of sequences of three different segments of the rRNA gene cluster indicated that the parasite was in the Saprolegniaceae family, and is related to other crustacean-associated Saprolegniaceae. Specific primers were designed based on the SSU rRNA gene and utilized for semi-quantitative analysis of parasite presence in live and dead amphipods. In laboratory experiments, infection prevalence was higher in E. ischnus individuals than in native amphipods. In addition, dead E. ischnus individuals exhibited more intense infections than G. fasciatus individuals. In contrast to the Great Lakes where E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus at many locations, the native species remains abundant in the St. Lawrence River more than a decade after invasion by E. ischnus in the late 1990s.

Using this stoloniferous E. crassipes as a model, we studied the effects of light and nitrate availability on growth and nitrate assimilation in inter-connected parent and offspring ramets. Our results showed that increase in light and nitrate availability significantly increased growth rate of the whole clonal fragments and reproduction of offspring ramets in E. crassipes. In addition, increases in nitrate reductase (NR) activity and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity were observed in both parent and offspring ramets with increase in light density and nitrate supply. We also found that nitrate translocation is greater in offspring ramets than in parent ramets under abundant light and nitrate environment in this fast-growing clonal plant. Consequently, majority of nitrate assimilation in offspring ramets is beneficial to the growth of whole clonal system, as indicated by a close correlation between nitrate assimilation in offspring ramets and RGR of whole clonal fragments.

Post-introduction dispersal may occur naturally or via human transport, but assessing the relative contribution of each is difficult for many organisms. Here, we use data from seven microsatellite markers to study patterns of dispersal and gene flow among 12 pierhead populations of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in Lake Michigan. We find significant population structure among sampling sites within this single Great Lake: (1) numerous populations exhibited significant pairwise F (ST) and (2) a Bayesian assignment analysis revealed three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to different pierhead locations, and genetic admixture between these clusters in the remaining populations. Genetic differentiation (F (ST)) is generally related to geographic distance (i.e., isolation by distance), but is periodically interrupted at the scale of Lake Michigan due to gene flow among geographically distant sites. Moreover, average genetic differentiation among populations exhibit a significant, negative correlation with the amount of shipping cargo at ports. Our results, therefore, provide evidence that genetic structure of the round goby in Lake Michigan results from limited natural dispersal with frequent long-distance dispersal through anthropogenic activities such as commercial shipping. Our study suggests that while round gobies can undoubtedly disperse and found new populations through natural dispersal mechanisms, their spread within and among the Great Lakes is likely aided by transport via ships.

It predicts that exotic genera with native representatives should be less successful because of an overlap in resource use and of the existence of common specialised enemies. In this study, we tested whether native congenerics have more negative impact on exotic species than heterogenerics by increasing the effects of soil pathogens. We sampled soil in populations of three exotic species (Epilobium ciliatum, Impatiens parviflora and Stenactis annua) at sites with and without respective congeneric species. This soil was used as an inoculum for cultivating the first plant cohort, which included exotics, as well as native congenerics and heterogenerics. The conditioned soil was subsequently used for cultivating the second cohort of plants (exotics only). We found no consistent impact of relatedness of conditioning species on exotic growth. Although soil conditioned by congeneric E. hirsutum had the largest reduction on the performance of E. ciliatum, the final biomass of S. annua was lowest when grown in soil conditioned by itself. There was no effect of stimulating species on the biomass of I. parviflora. In both experimental phases, performance of exotics was improved when cultivated with sterilised inoculua, indicating the dominance of soil generalist pathogens. However, the biomass of S. annua was increased most by congeneric-stimulated inoculum from congeneric sites, suggesting a possible role for specialised symbionts.

In this study, we explored variation among soils of three forest types in their resistance to invasion by Mikania micrantha H.B.K. in lower subtropical China; this species is one of the top ten most invasive weeds in the world. In model systems of soils from different forests, M. micrantha performed worst on undisturbed late-successional stage forest (monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest, MEBF) soils and did not appear to take advantage of abundant soil nutrients. These results could reflect that a potential inhibitory effect was driven by MEBF soil. Plant litter is an important component of soils, litter bioassay and addition experiments demonstrated native plant species from different forests differentially confer invasion resistance and affect the performance of exotic plants. Naturally, other factors such as the relative abundances of nutrients, microbial feedbacks, could have contributed to these results as well.

Raccoon dogs used various types of shelters but were invariably concealed in dense vegetation or in the shelters created by trunks, branches, or roots of fallen trees (58% of days). Burrows (mainly badger setts) and hollow trees (mainly fallen limes) were selected on 27% and 14% of days, respectively. The pattern of shelter use varied throughout the year. In crucial periods (breeding period and winter), raccoon dogs used shelter offering better protection: burrows and hollow trees (use of which increased with decreasing ambient temperature) in winter, and hollow trees and dense vegetation during breeding and raising pups. The pattern of shelter use by raccoon dogs was also strongly modified by forest structure. Raccoon dogs living in the pristine old-growth stands (with large amounts of dead wood) utilized mainly natural shelters created by fallen trees (trunks, branches, and roots) and sedge tussocks (38% and 37%, respectively). Individuals inhabiting the managed part of the Forest used mainly burrows (43%) and thicket (23%). We recorded very strong monogamous relationships between pair mates, manifested by shared resting on 84% of days per year.

Instead, these spiders' growth is well described by a developmental growth rate (weight gain per moult) and a growth coefficient (weight gain per development time), both of which are based on a geometric progression. All developmental parameters, including developmental growth rate and growth coefficient as well as the intermoult duration and the number of instars, highly depend on food availability in L. sclopetarius and thus show plasticity. 4.

Here, we study the dynamics of postestablishment colonization in the colonial ascidian Botrylloides violaceus, a notorious marine invader. After its initial introduction from the Northwest Pacific, B. violaceus spread rapidly along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, impacting both aquaculture facilities and natural ecosystems. We compare genetic diversity and patterns of gene flow among 25 populations (N = 679) from the West and East coasts, and evaluate the contribution of sexual vs. asexual reproduction to this species' invasion success using data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and 13 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci. Our results reveal contrasting patterns of spread in the coastal waters of North America. While the West coast was colonized by noncontiguous (long-distance) dispersal, the East coast invasion appears to have occurred through contiguous (stepping-stone) spread. Molecular data further indicate that although dispersal in colonial ascidians is predominantly achieved through sexually produced propagules, aquaculture practices such as high-pressure washing can facilitate fragmentation and potentially exacerbate infestations and spread via asexual propagules. The results presented here suggest that caution should be used against the general assumption that all invasions, even within a single species, exhibit similar patterns of colonization, as highly contrasting dynamics may transpire in different invaded ranges.",Web of Science,Botrylloides violaceus,USA,,,,,Field - Observational,marine,,Fundamentals,,,filter

Few studies, however, have experimentally tested the interaction of these two mechanisms. We initiated a study in a southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.)/bunch grass system to determine the susceptibility of remnant native plant communities to cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion, and persistence of cheatgrass in invaded areas. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design consisting of two levels of aboveground biomass removal and two levels of reciprocal seeding. We seeded cheatgrass seeds in native plots and a native seed mixture in cheatgrass plots. Two biomass removal disturbances and sowing seeds over 3 years did not reverse cheatgrass dominance in invaded plots or native grass dominance in non-invaded native plots. Our results suggest that two factors dictated the persistence of the resident communities. First, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey) was the dominant native herbaceous species on the study site. This species is typically a poor competitor with cheatgrass as a seedling, but is a strong competitor when mature. Second, differences in pretreatment levels of plant-available soil nitrogen and phosphorus may have favored the dominant species in each community. Annual species typically require higher levels of plant-available soil nutrients than perennial plants. This trend was observed in the annual cheatgrass community and perennial native community.

To generate a monoculture, the invader must garner more resources than resident natives and, once established, persist despite high densities of conspecific neighbors. Coincident with expansion and long-term persistence, successful invaders typically accumulate senesced material, but the role of this litter in mediating the invader's ability to establish and maintain monospecific dominance has rarely been investigated. We used stands of the common reed, Phragmites australis, a prolific wetland invader in North America, to explore the impact of litter on interspecific competition with the native rush, Juncus gerardii, and intraspecific competition among live shoots. In 10 x 10 m areas positioned on Phragmites expansion fronts, we removed litter to isolate its effect from live Phragmites on light availability, aboveground biomass and community composition. Compared to adjacent, unmanipulated fronts, light availability nearly tripled and Juncus biomass increased > 170% in litter removal areas after 4 months. Although the positive response of Juncus and native forbs was most pronounced on the leading edge of Phragmites stands, litter removal triggered a 271% increase in native plant biomass even in the interior of stands where Phragmites' live stem density was highest. Litter treatment did not significantly affect Phragmites biomass, but more, shorter stems emerged in litter removals revealing Phragmites modifies stem phenotype in response to local litter and light conditions. These results suggest that litter plays a central role in Phragmites' invasion process, from initial establishment to subsequent monospecific dominance.

Result We find strong support for the first hypothesis providing further evidence of biotic resistance at small scales. However, at large scales, native and exotic species were also more distantly related than expected. Importantly, however, natives and exotics were more distantly related at small scales than they were at large scales, suggesting that in the transition from small to large scales, biotic resistance is relaxed but still present. Communities at large scales were not saturated in the sense that more species could enter the community, increasing species richness. However, species did not invade indiscriminately. Exotic species closely related to species already established the community were excluded. Main conclusions Native communities determine the identity of exotic invaders even at large spatial scales where communities are unsaturated. These results hold promise for predicting which species will invade a community given the species present.",Web of Science,Many,USA,California,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

One largely anecdotal observation is that polluted or degraded areas will accumulate more invaders than less-impacted sites. However, the role of abiotic factors alone in influencing invisibility has been difficult to isolate, often because the supply of potential invaders is confounded with conditions thought to increase vulnerability to invasion. Here, we conducted a field experiment to test how the assemblages of exotic versus native marine invertebrates changed during community assembly under different exposure levels of a common pollutant, copper. The experiment was conducted by deploying fouling panels in a Randomized Block Design in San Francisco Bay. Panels were periodically removed, placed into buckets with differing copper concentrations, and returned to the field after 3 days. This design allowed propagule availability to the plates to be statistically independent of short-term copper exposure. The results demonstrate that copper caused significant differences in community structure. Average native species richness was significantly affected by copper exposure, but average exotic richness was not. The total native species pool within treatments exhibited a greater than 40% decline within increasing copper, while the exotic species pool did not change significantly. These results confirm that anthropogenic alteration of abiotic factors influences invader success, indicating that management strategies to reduce invader impacts should include both efforts to improve environmental conditions as well as reduce invader supply.",Web of Science,Many,USA,California,San Francisco Estuary,,,Field - Experimental,estuarine,,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary;filter

In this study, we evaluated light as a potential environmental limitation to the spread of Cape ivy into inland regions of the western United States. Cape ivy was collected from four locations representing the north to south range. Plants were grown for 9 to 11 weeks in full sunlight and under two shade regimes (20 and 6% of full sunlight). The experiment was conducted twice at two temperature regimes. Results show some within- and among-population variability, with the southernmost San Diego County population having the highest biomass under the warmer growing conditions and the three northern populations responding most favorably in the cooler growing conditions. Despite the minor differences within and between populations, Cape ivy grew very poorly in full sunlight in both experiments. Although plants growing under 6% light grew better than those in full sunlight, they were far less robust compared to plants growing at 20% light. Our results indicate that while Cape ivy will not persist in areas with prolonged high intensity sunlight, characterized by much of the interior regions of California and Oregon, it is expected to invade and spread in areas with reduced light, including coastal regions frequently exposed to fog or cloudy conditions, or sub-canopy layers of riparian forests or woodlands.

Soc. 138: 85-92. 2011.-Mature and old-growth forests are often thought to be buffered against invasive species due to low levels of light and infrequent disturbance. Lianas (woody vines) and other climbing plants are also known to exhibit lower densities in older forests. As part of a larger survey of the lianas of the southern Lake Michigan region in mature and old-growth forests, the level of infestation by invasive lianas was evaluated. The only invasive liana detected in these surveys was Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. (Celastraceae). Although this species had only attached to trees and reached the canopy in a few instances, it was present in 30% of transects surveyed, mostly as a component of the ground layer. Transects with C orbiculatus had higher levels of soil potassium and higher liana richness than transects without. In contrast, transects with the native scandens had higher pH, sand content, and soil magnesium and lower organic matter compared to transects where it was absent. Celastrus orbiculatus appears to be a generalist liana since it often occurs with native lianas. Celastrus orbiculatus poses a substantial threat to mature forests as it will persist in the understory until a canopy gap or other disturbance provides the light and supports necessary for it to ascend to the canopy and damage tree species. As a result, these forests should be monitored by land managers so that C orbiculatus eradication can occur while invasions are at low densities and restricted to the ground layer.",Web of Science,Celastrus orbiculatus,USA,Michigan,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

In the invasive Fallopia spp. complex, hybridization between taxa of various ploidy levels has been experimentally demonstrated. Extensive genetic variation has also been observed among hybrids in the field. However, what makes a certain hybridization event of evolutionary importance is still the subject of speculation considering the invasive potential of hybrid Fallopia. Aims The present study examined landscape scale patterns of interspecific hybridization within the alien invasive Fallopia complex, and tested whether cold winter might act as selective agent for hybrid survival. Methods Eighty seeds per clone were collected from four taxa (F. japonica, F. sachalinensis, F aubertii, and F. x bohemica) and sown in greenhouse and outdoor conditions. Ploidy levels of the resulting seedlings were determined by flow cytometry at early stages of seedling growth and compared to those of mature clones present in the same landscapes. Key results The four studied taxa were involved in interspecific hybridization patterns. Seedlings resulting from hybridization had a large range of ploidy levels, including aneuploid and euploid progeny, and polyploid levels that were not observed in mature clones. Cold winter had a negative effect on germination success. However, a comparison of ploidy levels of seedlings that survived the cold winter with those grown under greenhouse conditions indicated that cold winter was not a significant selection agent for particular ploidy levels. Conclusions Our results stress the importance of interspecific hybridization and polyploidization events in generating invasive hybrids in the alien Fallopia spp. complex. Cold winter represents a selection agent for the survival of early stages of progeny but does not explain the discrepancies in ploidy levels between produced seedlings and currently occurring mature clones.",Web of Science,Fallopia spp,,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,primary

All traits were measured in a series of pot experiments, and leaf traits additionally in the field. Invasive forbs differed from native forbs for only a few traits; they had less leaf chlorophyll and lower phosphorus (P) uptake from soil, but they tended to have a stronger allelopathic effect. The invasive forbs differed in many traits from the native graminoids, their leaves had lower tissue densities and a shorter life span, their litter decomposed faster and they had a lower nitrogen-use efficiency.

Subsequently, these clones were flooded with water levels of 0, 9, and 18 cm above the soil surface. Severing rhizomes decreased growth and clonal reproduction of daughter ramets, and increased those of mother ramets grown in shallow and deep water.

The Asian green mussel, Perna viridis, has been introduced into coastal waters of Florida where its current distribution is hypothesized to be limited by low temperatures during winter. Lethal and sub-lethal effects (heat shock protein/Hsp70 expression) of cold water and air temperatures were analyzed in two size classes of P. viridis from Florida in an effort to determine the effects of current and forecasted temperatures on the potential for range expansion. Mussels were exposed to water temperatures of 14, 10, 7 and 3 degrees C for up to 30 days, or to air temperatures of 14, 7, 0 and -10 degrees C for periods of 2 hr. Mortality was significantly increased at all water and air temperaturesr <= 14 degrees C. No differences in mortality rates were observed between small (15-45 mm) and large (75-105 mm) size classes except after exposure to 7 degrees C air, in which small mussels had higher mortality. Significant increases in Hsp70 expression were observed after a 2-hour exposure to 10 degrees C water, but Hsp70 expression was not significantly increased at any temperatures in which mortality was not also significant. The temperature threshold for survival in this population appears to be between 10 and 14 degrees C, suggesting that under current conditions P. viridis may already be at the northern edge of its potential range in the United States.

Globally, first flowering dates (FFDs) have advanced by several days per decade in response to recent climate warming, but, while earlier flowering should allow plant distributions to increase, a link between FFD and range changes has not been observed. Here I show for 347 species that the extent to which FFD has responded to climate warming is linked to the degree to which their relative distributions have changed over 30 yr across the British Isles. Native plant species whose phenology did not track climate change declined in distribution, whereas species that became more widespread all exhibited earlier flowering. In contrast, alien neophytes showed both a stronger phenological response to warming and a more marked increase in distribution, but no link between the two. These trends were consistent both for relative changes in the national distribution and for local abundance.

Except for populations with Allee effects, an invader's growth rate when rare and dispersal determine its spread velocity; intraspecific competition has little to no influence. How this result might change with landscape patchiness, however, is poorly understood. We used simulation models and their analytical approximations to explore the effect of density dependence on the spread of annual plant invaders moving through heterogeneous landscapes with gaps in suitable habitat. We found that landscape patchiness and discrete invader population size interacted to generate a strong role for density dependence. Intraspecific competition greatly slowed the spread of invasions through patchy landscapes by regulating how rapidly a population could produce enough seeds to surpass habitat gaps. Populations with continuously varying density showed no such effect of density dependence. We adapted a stochastic dispersal model to approximate spread when gap sizes were small relative to the mean dispersal distance and a Markov chain approximation for landscapes with large gaps.

There is much debate about the generality of this rule, and recent studies on plant and fish introductions have been inconclusive. Information on phylogenetic relatedness is potentially valuable for explaining invasion outcomes and could form part of screening protocols for minimizing future invasions. We provide the first test of this hypothesis for terrestrial vertebrates using two new molecular phylogenies for native and introduced reptiles for two regions with the best data on introduction histories. Location California and Florida, USA. Methods We performed an ordination of ecological traits to confirm that ecologically similar species are indeed closely related phylogenetically. We then inferred molecular phylogenies for introduced and native reptiles using sequence data for two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes. Using these phylogenies, we computed two distance metrics: the mean phylogenetic distance (MPD) between each introduced species and all native species in each region (which indicates the potential interactions between introduced species and all native species in the community) and the distance of each introduced species to its nearest native relative - NN (indicating the degree of similarity and associated likelihood of competition between each introduced species and its closest evolutionary analogue). These metrics were compared for introduced species that established and those that failed. Results We demonstrate that phylogenetically related species do share similar ecological functions. Furthermore, successfully introduced species are more distantly related to natives (for NN and MPD) than failed species, although variation is high.

Location Valparaiso Region, central Chile Methods We sampled seed rain, seedbank emergence and establishment of species in four paired burned and unburned areas and compared (using GLMM) fire resistance and propagule arrival of alien and native species. To assess the relative importance of seed dispersal and seedbank survival in explaining plant establishment after fire, we compared seed rain and seedbank structure with post-fire vegetation using ordination analyses. Results Fire did not change the proportion of alien species in the coastal matorral. However, fire increased the number of annual species (natives and aliens) of which 87% were aliens. Fire reduced the alien seedbank and not the native seedbank, but alien species remained dominant in burned soil samples (66% of the total species richness). Seed rain was higher for alien annuals than for native annuals or perennials, thus contributing to their establishment after fire. Nevertheless, seed rain was less important than seedbank survival in explaining plant establishment in burned areas. Main conclusions Anthropogenic fires favoured alien and native annuals. Thus, fire did not increase the alien/native ratio but increased the richness of alien species. The successful establishment of alien annuals was attributable to their ability to maintain rich seedbanks in burned areas and to the greater propagule arrival compared to native species. The native seedbank also survived fire, indicating that the herbaceous community has become highly resilient after centuries of human disturbances.

Distance to water was the most important predictor for Russian olive presence in our coarse-scale water model, but it was only the fifth most important variable in the fine-scale model, suggesting that when water bodies are considered on a fine scale, Russian olive does not necessarily rely on water.

We asked: (1) Do resource availability and community structure affect the establishment of L. cuneata?, and (2) Are resource availability and community structure associated with patterns of L. cuneata abundance from neighborhood scales to old-field scales? To investigate the first question, we manipulated soil nitrogen (N) availability at three levels in an existing old-field community and tracked emergence and persistence of L. cuneata seedlings, as well as total plant biomass of the community, availability of light, and soil moisture content. To address the second question, we performed surveys in which we estimated L. cuneata foliar cover at community scales (50-m(2) belt transects) and old-field scales (total area of 28 ha), and assessed the same biotic and abiotic variables as in the field experiment. The experiment revealed that establishment and persistence by L. cuneata seedlings were 15x and 5x lower in N-added plots than in N-reduced plots. Total plant community biomass was 30% greater in N-added plots than in N-reduced plots. Conversely, light and soil moisture were 60 and 20% lower in N-added plots than in N-reduced plots. Surveys of old fields indicated that community biomass was positively associated with L. cuneata cover at old-field scales likely resulting from greater soil N input from nitrogen fixation in fields with greater L. cuneata cover.

The study was conducted within grazing pastures, where S. invicta can be extremely abundant while also exhibiting substantial variability in abundance. A path analysis showed that the abundance of S. invicta was strongly and positively affected by the abundance of an invasive honeydew-producing mealybug native to Asia, Antonina graminis, and by the mealybugs' host grasses because of their strong positive effect on mealybug abundance. Abundance of the mealybug was primarily attributable to an invasive host grass native to Africa, Cynodon dactylon.

To address the interaction of these factors on non-native species richness, we recorded the presence of non-native annual plant species along an altitudinal gradient on Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). We compared the distributions of species differing in bioclimatic origin (Mediterranean and temperate) and time since introduction (old and recent introductions), and compared richness patterns of these groups in anthropogenic and natural habitats. Non-native species richness increased strongly from lowlands to midaltitudes, but dropped sharply at the transition from anthropogenic to natural habitats, and thereafter declined with altitude in the natural habitat. This pattern indicates that the altitude effects reflected changes in both climate and habitat context. Mediterranean and temperate species were distributed similarly along the altitudinal gradient, and we found no effect of bioclimatic origin on species distributions. As almost all species present at the highest sites also occurred in the lowlands, we conclude that most species were introduced to lowland sites and were therefore pre-adapted to those climatic conditions (lowland introduction filter). The altitudinal ranges of species tended to increase with time since introduction, and the species reaching the highest altitudes were mostly old introductions. This effect of time was more pronounced among Mediterranean than temperate species. Thus, while climatic pre-adaptation is important for establishment along this altitudinal gradient, species tend to extend their altitudinal range with time.",Web of Science,Many,Spain,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Preadaptation to Climate,,primary

We assess the current status of plant invasion in Galapagos, predict the likelihood of future naturalizations and invasions from the existing introduced flora, and suggest measures to help limit future invasions. There has been a 1.46 fold increase in plant biodiversity in Galapagos due to alien plant naturalizations, reflecting a similar trend on islands elsewhere. There are 870 alien plant species recorded in the archipelago. Of evaluated species, 34% species have naturalized. Within this group are the invasive species (16% of evaluated) and the transformers (3.3% of evaluated). We show that, as expected, naturalized species have been present in the archipelago longer than non-naturalized species. We also find that a higher human-mediated propagule pressure is associated with a greater human population and with properties that have been settled longer. This, combined with the relatively recent introduction of most species, leads us to the conclusion that Galapagos is at an early stage of plant invasion. We predict that more species from the existing alien flora will find an opportunity to naturalize and invade as propagule pressure increases alongside rapid human population growth associated with immigration to serve the booming tourism industry. In order to reduce future invasion risk, we suggest reviewing inter-island quarantine measures and continuing community education efforts to reduce human-mediated propagule pressure.",Web of Science,Many,Ecuador,Galapagos Islands,,,,,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,primary

In total, 221 individuals were sampled at three spatial scales: inter-regional, within-region, and at a high-resolution local scale. It was observed that there were high levels of genetic variation between most populations, that invasive populations were generally distinct from both native populations and from each other and that genetic variation away from founding populations can occur relatively quickly and within a small geographic area. Changes in the pattern of genetic variation observed in invasive populations strongly indicated that founder effects and genetic drift played a significant role in shaping their genetic structure.

We surveyed introduced roadside weeds along altitudinal transects ranging from 30 to 4,100 min Hawai'i, with the objectives of (1) testing the hypothesis that a mass effect due to mixing of tropical and temperate species at mid-elevation promotes a hump-shaped pattern of introduced species richness with altitude, and (2) testing the potential roles of anthropogenic activity, energy (temperature) and water-energy dynamics (productivity-diversity hypothesis) in determining introduced weed richness. A total of 178 introduced weeds were recorded. Introduced weed richness does not decline monotonically with altitude. Rather, mixing of tropical and temperate species helps to maintain high mean richness up to 2,000 m, suggesting a mass effect, but without a distinct richness peak. Patchy occurrence of a transformer species, Pennisetum clandestinum, introduced high variance in richness at mid-elevations. General linear models considering estimated actual evapotranspiration (AET, a measure of energy-water dynamics) together with an index of human activity (distance from urban area or length of major roads) accounted for more variance in introduced weed richness than models with energy alone (temperature) and human activity. Native Hawaiian species richness along roadsides was also weakly correlated with AET but negatively associated with human activity. Our observed association between introduced species richness and AET mirrors patterns reported for native species richness around the world, indicating that AET-richness patterns can develop on a short time scale (on the order of 100 years). To test the generality of introduced weed richness patterns, we tried using the Hawai'i island model to predict weed richness on the neighboring island of Maui. Although weed richness on Maui was under-predicted, the same predictors (human activity and AET) were important on Maui. Scaling for differences in regional human population density or economic activity (both higher on Maui) may allow more accurate and transferable quantitative predictions of introduced weed richness patterns.",Web of Science,Many,United States,Hawaii,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Temperate invaders that utilize seasonal cues to influence their life histories may be expected to behave differently in the tropics. This study examined variation in life history in an invading temperate weed, Verbascum thapsus, across an elevation gradient (1,690-2,720 m) along the montane and subalpine slopes of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Over 7,000 seedlings were marked and monitored over a period of 3 years. Germination, survival, growth, and reproduction in V. thapsus varied among sites along the elevational gradient. Compared to plants at lower elevations, those at higher elevation sites (>2,000 m) had lower early seedling survival, higher established rosette survival, higher vegetative growth rates, higher threshold sizes for flowering, and commonly lived more than 3 years before flowering. The abundance of competing vegetation generally decreased with elevation, and this may drive variation in V. thapsus survival and growth. Size-dependent survival appears to play a major role in the selection for smaller size at first flowering and shorter generation time at lower elevations. This pattern is opposite to that reported in temperate mountains where high elevation plants flower sooner and at smaller size, but both patterns appear consistent with general life history theory for biennials. Due to novel biotic and climatic interactions in the tropics, predictions of growth patterns and invasion dynamics for temperate weeds in the tropics can be misleading when based on the plant's behavior in temperate systems.",Web of Science,Verbascum thapsus,United States,Hawaii,Mauna Kea,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

Predictions of this hypothesis include lower herbivore abundances, diversity, and damage on introduced plant species compared to native ones. Greater density or diversity of predators and parasitoids on exotic versus native plants may also reduce regulation of exotic plants by herbivores. To test these predictions, we measured arthropod abundance, arthropod diversity, and foliar damage on invasive Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) and three native tree species: silver maple (Acer saccharinum), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). Arthropod samples were collected with canopy sweep nets from six 20 year old monoculture plots of each species at a southeast Texas site. A total of 2,700 individuals and 285 species of arthropods were caught. Overall, the species richness and abundance of arthropods on tallow tree were similar to the natives. But, ordination (NMS) showed community composition differed on tallow tree compared to all three native trees. It supported an arthropod community that had relatively lower herbivore abundance but relatively more predator species compared to the native species examined. Leaves were collected to determine damage. Tallow tree experienced less mining damage than native trees. The results of this study supported the Enemies Release Hypothesis predictions that tallow tree would have low herbivore loads which may contribute to its invasive success.

We examined its reproductive traits in an attempt to account for its remarkable invasive success. 2. For the first time in this species, we found males, dioecy (gonochorism) and an exclusively sexual mode of reproduction; no indication for hermaphroditism or (unisexual) parthenogenesis, that could explain the rapid range expansion of H. invalida, was found. 3. Our experimental evidence shows that H. invalida reproduces by males discharging their sperm into the water column while eggs are retained and fertilised in the female dwelling tubes. This mode of 'spermcast' reproduction is common in sessile benthic animals on wave-washed shores. 4. Fecundity of H. invalida ranged between 60 and 260 eggs per clutch and is increased by iteroparity (i.e. multiple cycles of oogenesis and egg-laying per specimen). Offspring are brooded for about 2 weeks before they leave the maternal dwelling tubes and disperse in the water column. 5. After connection to a supply of Rhine water, sediments in flumes were rapidly colonised up to a density of 12 000 ind. m(-2) via the settlement of small larvae (< 300 mu m) from the water column; these reached sexual maturity approximately 12 weeks after settlement. 6. The reproductive traits of H. invalida give the species a high rate of dispersal. The capacity of its larvae to survive passage through pumps before settlement enables them to travel in the ballast water of ships. This might explain the upstream expansion of H. invalida in rivers. We conclude that further range expansion, and especially intercontinental transport of this polychaete, can only be prevented by improved ballast water treatment.",Web of Science,Hypania invalida,,,,,,Lab,lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,High Reprod.

One often cited mechanism is that multiple introductions of invasive species prevent genetic bottlenecks by parallel introductions of several distinct genotypes that, in turn, provide heritable variation necessary for local adaptation. Here, we show that the invasion of Aegilops triuncialis into California, USA, involved multiple introductions that may have facilitated invasion into serpentine habitats. Using microsatellite markers, we compared the polymorphism and genetic structure of populations of Ae. triuncialis invading serpentine soils in California to that of accessions from its native range. In a glasshouse study, we also compared phenotypic variation in phenological and fitness traits between invasive and native populations grown on loam soil and under serpentine edaphic conditions. Molecular analysis of invasive populations revealed that Californian populations cluster into three independent introductions (i.e. invasive lineages). Our glasshouse common garden experiment found that all Californian populations exhibited higher fitness under serpentine conditions. However, the three invasive lineages appear to represent independent pathways of adaptation to serpentine soil.

Here, the genetic and phenotypic traits of Japanese populations were examined, together with 11 native populations of the USA using 10 microsatellite markers and six meristic traits. Phylogenetic analysis reconfirmed a single origin of Japanese populations, among which populations established in the 1960s were genetically close to Guttenberg population, keeping high genetic diversity comparable to the ancestral population. In contrast, genetic diversity of later-established populations significantly declined with genetic divergence from the ancestral population. Among the 1960s established populations, that from Lake Biwa showed a significant isolation-by-distance pattern with surrounding populations in which genetic bottlenecks increased with geographical distance from Lake Biwa. Although phenotypic divergence among populations was recognized in both neutral and adaptive traits, P(ST)-F(ST) comparisons showed that it is independent of neutral genetic divergence. Divergent selection was suggested in some populations from reservoirs with unstable habitats, while stabilizing selection was dominant. Accordingly, many Japanese populations of L. macrochirus appear to have derived from Lake Biwa population, expanding their distribution with population bottlenecks. Despite low propagule pressure, the invasion success of L. macrochirus is probably because of its drastic population growth in Lake Biwa shortly after its introduction, together with artificial transplantations.

Using a spatially explicit model of consumer foraging and plant competition, we demonstrate how the relationship between the spatial area over which plants compete and the spatial scale of consumer behaviour can determine the outcome of competition when one plant species provides a refuge for mobile consumers (i.e. refuge-mediated apparent competition). Once an initial population of the invader is established, complete invasion may be inevitable because of an ever-advancing invasion front ratchets forward driven by a feeding front of mobile consumers. Because the spatial extent of apparent competition determines the area available for colonization, consumers may also dictate the rate at which an invasion occurs. We find that, as long as refuge-mediated apparent competition is sufficiently localized, invasion is possible even in systems characterized by low overall levels of consumer pressure. Moreover, we show that a stable equilibrium can result in which both resident and invading plants coexist, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity created by refuge-mediated apparent competition may be important in mediating coexistence in plant communities.

Methods: We investigated the short-term effects of the nonnative plant Hypochaeris radicata on growth of native species colonizing drought-prone primary successional surfaces under N-limited and N-augmented conditions. To understand the success of H. radicata, we compared its resource use efficiency to that of a closely related native colonist, Hieracium albiflorum, under the same conditions. Key results: Removing H. radicata did not affect growth of the most common colonists, but N addition demonstrated strong N limitation to growth in H. albiflorum, H. radicata, and Agrostis spp. Nonnative H. radicata exhibited lower water-use efficiency than H. albiflorum but did not differ in efficiency of N use. H. radicata biomass increased faster in response to an N pulse than did the native H. albiflorum, as did the pool of N held in H. radicata tissues. Conclusions: Our findings contrast with results from Hawaiian volcanic sites, where higher short-term resource use efficiency was reported for invasive species, including H. radicata. Our results suggest that at MSH, the success of H. radicata relies on rapid uptake and utilization of N rather than on higher efficiency.

In each stand, 20 ramets were permanently marked to estimate the monthly variations in such growth variables as phenology, height and diameter of the ramet canopy, number of flowers, leaves and fruits. The results showed a significant variation in growth variables relative to habitat types. Generally, I. carnea populations along the railway sides and field edges had the lowest values for most variables; while those of the road dividers, road sides and canal banks produced the highest values. The growth of I. carnea follows a seasonal pattern where the highest values for most growth variables were obtained during September and October and the lowest were recorded during June and July. The greatest flower and fruit production was observed between September and December. Similarly, it was shown that the flowering time varied in relation to habitat types; it began earlier on road sides and canal banks, but later on railway sides, road dividers and waste lands. Leaf areas of I. carnea populations in the wet habitats (e.g. drain and canal banks) were higher than those in other habitats. These results are discussed in relation to other related studies.",Web of Science,Ipomoea carnea,Egypt,,,,,Field - Observational,wetland,Wetland,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary

E. canadensis thrived in 132 out of 1,227 reaches examined and in 12 of the 39 watercourses surveyed. It grew in the company of a variety of species, most frequently with different species of Potamogeton. It was rarely found as the prevailing, and never as the only species in any reach. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of reaches with E. canadensis revealed that the presence of detritus, retention structures and properties of the riparian zone explained most of the variance in community composition. Habitat analysis of well-established stands of E. canadensis showed that its preferred habitats were watercourses flowing through agricultural landscape, with a narrow, more or less disturbed riparian zone, with moderate presence of retention structures, and with sediment that was a mixture of gravel, sand and silt with either coarse or fine organic matter. It was not found in the parts of streams with the most dynamic flow, and was absent from watercourses in the karst region, due to the frequent and extreme water level fluctuations.

We investigated whether local environmental factors in urban water bodies, such as water quality, habitat structure and biotic interactions, influenced the invasion of these systems by exotic macroinvertebrate species. Location Urban surface water systems in lowlands of the Rhine-Meuse delta. Methods Presence and abundance of native and exotic macroinvertebrate species were compared between different urban water types and related to environmental variables with multivariate analysis and spearman's correlations. Moreover, co-existence of related native and exotic species was studied. Results In total nine exotic species were found in the following taxa: Tricladida (1), Crustacea (5), Bivalvia (1) and Gastropoda (2). Taxonomically related native and exotic crustacean species did not seem to be influenced by competition in nutrient-rich urban waters; most species showed high abundances. Nevertheless, two exotic crustacean species were much more abundant in waters where other crustacean species were absent, possibly filling empty niches. Native species richness and abundance was positively related to environmental heterogeneity in the form of submerged vegetation. The occurrence and abundance of most exotic species were positively related to several eutrophication indicators, such as nitrate, sludge layer and lemnid vegetation. Main conclusions Exotic species in urban waters were mostly detritivorous or omnivorous and therefore dependent on leaf breakdown. In nutrient-rich water systems, where food availability was high, exotic crustacean species co-existed with native crustacean species, while in nutrient-poor, richly vegetated systems, native Asellidae dominated exotic Asellidae. In the turbid water bodies with very little vegetation, native species richness was low and two exotic crustacean species were relatively abundant in these water systems. Invasibility of urban water systems could be reduced by stimulating the development of submerged and nymphaeid vegetation and decreasing nutrient levels.",Web of Science,Many,The Netherlands,,,,,Field - Observational,lentic;lotic,Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Empty Niche,,

However, the degree of invasion, particularly in mainland areas, has often been underestimated because of the exclusion of 'domestic exotics' (those introduced to internal units from within the national border) in calculations. Because all introduced species on islands are considered as exotics, this contributes to the perception that islands are more susceptible to invasion than are continental regions. Here, we determine the contribution of domestic exotic species to the degree of invasion (exotic fraction) in mainland areas. We quantify the relationships of exotic fraction to the area, human population density and land use within each of the 48 conterminous US states to identify mechanisms that potentially influence the degree of invasion. For each of the 48 conterminous US states, we compiled the number of species introduced from outside the United States ('foreign exotics') and the number of exotics introduced from other conterminous US states ('domestic exotics'). The status of each species as foreign or domestic was determined for each state by researching its precise origins through vouchered herbarium records, supplemented by literature (Kartesz, 2010). We found that (1) the exotic fraction inevitably decreases with increasing area as the pool of potential exotic species decreases; (2) exotic richness of areas within large mainland regions is underestimated to the extent that species introduced among areas within a region are considered as natives; and (3) human activities contribute disproportionately more exotics to smaller than to larger administrative areas. How we define 'exotic' influences how we count non-native species and perceive invasibility. Excluding domestic exotics in mainland regions leads to a biased perception of increased invasibility on islands, where all introduced species are considered exotic. Thus, future documentation and interpretation of invasion patterns and management of exotics should account for these biases in quantifying the exotic fraction.",Web of Science,Many,United States,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

Location Temperate and subtropical countries and regions (n = 60) from five continents spanning both hemispheres. Methods We used generalized linear mixed models to test how continent identity, region area and use in commercial forestry affect probabilities of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species to escape following introduction and cumulative logit regression models to assess how these predictors affect the likelihood that a species becomes naturalized or invasive. Results Sixty Pinaceae of a global total of 232 and 26 Cupressaceae of a total of 142 species have escaped from cultivation across the study regions examined. Average numbers of both alien Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species per region were highest in Oceania, followed by Africa. Moreover, the probability of alien Cupressaceae and Pinaceae becoming naturalized or invasive was particularly high in these two continents. For both families, species used in commercial forestry have a significantly higher probability of escape than those which are only introduced for ornamental or other purposes. In the case of Pinaceae, forestry species also become naturalized or invasive more frequently than non-forestry species, while no such effect was detectable for Cupressaceae. Conclusions We found that non-native conifers are more likely to escape from cultivation, naturalize and turn into invasive weeds on the continents of the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to this biogeographic signal, introduction effort strongly determines the behaviour of introduced Pinaceae, and less so, Cupressaceae.

Since invasions involve an increase in abundance or dominance of a species in its non-native range, competitive effects might be expected to be stronger in the non-native range of an invader; however, there have been few comparisons of the competitive effects of invasive plants on species from invaded ranges versus species from native ranges. We compared the competitive and allelopathic effects of Acroptilon repens on native North American species to effects on related species from the native range of Acroptilon in Uzbekistan. We also compared the competitive interactions among these North American and Eurasian species, in the absence of Acroptilon, examining the hypothesis that particular regional species pools may show differences in competitive ability. The results showed that Acroptilon had stronger competitive effects against native North American species than against species native to Uzbekistan.

Lonicera japonica occurred preferentially in areas of high litter cover and species richness, comparatively small trees, low PAR, low soil moisture and temperature, steep slopes, and shallow soils. Plant growth varied among these microhabitats. Among plots where L. japonica occurred, growth was related to soil and light conditions, and aspects of surrounding cover.

However, many concerns have been raised about large-scale plantations of new poplar cultivars. The deployment of such plants with novel traits brings the risk of potential spread of novel genome regions (including exotic genes, transgenes, or other heritable modifications) into natural populations of related species. The possibility of introgression is especially high in poplars because reproductive barriers between species are weak. Knowledge of the frequency of hybridization between cultivated trees and natural populations is one important step in the risk-assessment process. Methods: We studied the rate of spontaneous hybridization from two sexually mature poplar plantations into adjacent natural populations of Populus deltoides and P. balsamifera. The two plantations, both in eastern Canada, contain many different complex hybrid clones with components from exotic species, mostly P. nigra, P. trichocarpa, and P. maximowiczii. We analyzed 12 species-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms from six different genes in 5373 offspring sampled from the natural populations. Results: Contributions from all three exotics were found in the offspring, confirming low reproductive barriers among poplar species in these sections. The frequency of hybrid offspring varied among pollen donors, recipient populations, and years. Conclusions: The remarkably high rate of hybridization that was found in the smallest natural population sampled suggests that small peripheral populations carry a higher risk of introgression.

These traits also were compared between cultivated and invasive parents to identify any generational differences in invasive potential. Key results : Differences were detected in measures of reproductive ability, but no group emerged as consistently more fecund. Advanced-generation hybrids also had significantly less biomass, indicating a reduction in hybrid performance relative to that of the cultivated progeny.

Several hypotheses have been generated to explain the success of exotic plants in their new ranges, with escape from their old natural enemies, such as pathogens and herbivores (the 'enemy release hypothesis') and novel defensive chemistry (the 'novel weapons hypothesis') receiving considerable attention. Thus far, virtually all studies of exotic plants and insects have been conducted in a strictly bi-trophic framework involving plants and herbivores. On the other hand, it has been argued that a better understanding of the forces regulating community structure and function should include natural enemies of the herbivores. Furthermore, indirect interactions between organisms in the plant roots (below-ground) and shoots (above-ground) are known to strongly effect the behaviour and performance of consumers in the opposite 'compartment'. Here, we discuss a range of physiological, evolutionary and ecological aspects of plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions involving exotic plants. Further, interactions between soil and above-ground organisms are explored with respect to studies with exotic plants. We argue that it is important to link population and community ecology to individual-level variation in the physiology and behaviour of insects across several trophic levels in studies with invasive plants. Future research with invaders should also aim to integrate physically separated compartments (e.g, plant roots and shoots). This will facilitate a more complete understanding of the factors underlying the success (or failure) of exotic plants to spread and become dominant in their new ranges. Moreover, these data will also help to unravel the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes in regulating communities in which exotic plants have become established.

However, in one location it has failed to establish permitting an indigenous competitor to persist. In this area, the dominant plant host is Euphorbia cyathophora. Through a combination of laboratory and field experimentation we show that while both can utilise the young, upper leaves only the indigenous competitor can use the older lower leaves. We then demonstrate that the removal of the upper leaves as part of foreshore vegetation management is the key factor in preventing the establishment of the invader and subsequent displacement of its competitor. While human mediated disturbance coupled with complex biological interactions may promote invasion they may equally well retard rather than facilitate invasion, a factor that appears to have been largely ignored.

The role of allelopathy and competition in its invasiveness was investigated using Eragrostis curvula (weeping lovegrass, an indigenous grass), E. tef and Lactuca sativa (lettuce) as test species. Trials were conducted in Petri-dishes, pots and in the field. Root and shoot extracts of adult C. macrocephalum plants did not inhibit seed germination in any test species. The greatest effect was radicle stunting produced by leaf extracts at 10 and 25% w/v. Eragrostis curvula was less tolerant of the extracts than E. tef. Allelopathic effects could however not be confirmed in pot trials evaluating the interference potential of the weed or weed residue effects against E. curvula. E. curvula growth and biomass was not affected by plant densities of one or five C. macrocephalum per pot, whereas C. macrocephalum suffered a 17% mortality and density-dependant trade-offs of size and biomass for survival.

Finally, we tested the effects of short- and long-term soil conditioning on the performance and reproductive effort of C. edulis. Our results show that at first there is a natural resistance to invasion by the soil biota. Later, biotic resistance in invaded soil is suppressed by the establishment of a soil community that enhances the growth of C. edulis and that negatively influences the growth and survival of the native plants. Long-term soil conditioning in the field resulted in shifts in the balance between vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. Long-term invasion was also reflected in high levels of endophyte colonization by chytrids in roots, although the physiological consequences of this colonization remain unknown. The results obtained illustrate a mechanism that explains how C. edulis breaks the initial biotic resistance of newly-invaded landscapes. Finally, this study highlights the importance of studying plant-soil interactions on different members of the plant community and temporal stages in order to fully understand invasion.",Web of Science, Carpobrotus edulis,Portugal;Spain;South Africa,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Mutualism Facilitation;Ecosystem Engineers,,primary

Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to test the hypothesis that variation, in insect wing morphology patterns, occurs between sexes and along altitudinal gradients for invasive species, despite their recent association to this environment. We explored the variation in wing morphology between 12 invasive populations of the invasive potato pest, Tecia solanivora, at low and high altitude in the central highlands of Ecuador. After characterizing sexual dimorphism in wing shape, we investigated if moths at higher elevations differ in wing morphology from populations at lower altitudes. Results indicate wing shape and size differences between sexes and between altitudinal ranges. Females showed larger, wider wings than males, while high altitude moths showed larger, narrow-shaped wings by comparison to low-altitude moths. GLM analyses confirmed altitude was the only significant determinant of this gradient. Our study confirms a sexual dimorphism in size and wing shape for the potato moth. It also confirms and extends predictions of morphological changes with altitude to an invasive species, suggesting that wing morphology variation is an adapted response contributing to invasion success of the potato moth in mountainous landscapes. Ours is one of the first studies on the morphology of invasive insects and represents a valuable contribution to the study of insect invasions because it both offers empirical support to previous genetic studies on T. solanivora as well as proving broader insight into the mechanisms behind morphological evolution of a recently introduced pest.",Web of Science,Tecia solanivora,Ecuador,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,,Fundamentals,,,primary;parasite

The response of H. letourneuxi to chronic change in salinity was evaluated here by exposing fish to progressively increasing salinities (0-80 ppt). Fish were held at target salinities for a minimum of 30 days. The species showed excellent survival from 0-50 ppt. At 60 ppt, only 25% of the fish survived, and mean estimated survival time was 12 days. Above 60 ppt, mortality was 100%. Fish grew equally well from 0-50 ppt.

Long-distance dispersal or further introductions can obscure the pattern of spread, but the regional importance of such processes is difficult to gauge. These difficulties are further compounded when information on the multiple scale process of invasive species range expansion is reduced to one-dimensional estimates of spread (e. g. km yr(-1)). We therefore compared the results of two different metrics of range expansion: maximum linear rate of spread and accumulation of occupied grid squares (50 x 50 km) over time. An analysis of records for 54 species of introduced marine macrophytes in the Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic revealed cases where the invasion process was probably missed (e. g. Atlantic Bonnemaisonia hamifera) and suggested cases of secondary introductions or erratic jump dispersal (Dasysiphonia sp. and Womersleyella setacea). A majority of species analysed showed evidence for an accumulation of invaded sites without a clear invasion front. Estimates of spread rate are increasing for more recent introductions.

The dominance of invasive species is often assumed to reflect their competitive superiority over displaced native species. However, invasive species may be abundant because of their greater tolerance to anthropogenic impacts accompanying their introduction. Thus, invasive species can either be the drivers or passengers of change. 2. We distinguish between these two possibilities in California grasslands currently dominated by Mediterranean annuals (exotics) and subjected to livestock grazing since European settlement. We focused on native annual grasses and forbs, an understudied species-rich component of the California flora, and Mediterranean annual grasses, currently dominant and among the first non-native plants introduced to the area. 3. We established a field experiment with fenced and unfenced blocks in a cattle pasture. We measured concentrations of limiting resources (nitrogen, phosphorus, light and soil moisture) in monoculture plots as an index of competitive ability (i.e. R*). We then quantified grazing impacts on biomass and seed production in grazed vs. ungrazed monoculture plots. Finally, we measured biomass and seed production of each species competing in mixture plots, in the presence and absence of grazers. 4. We found that native and exotic species did not differ in R* indices of competitive ability, i.e. concentrations of limiting resources in ungrazed native monoculture plots did not differ from concentrations in ungrazed exotic monoculture plots. By contrast, exotic annuals suffered less from grazing than native annuals, perhaps reflecting their longer evolutionary history with cattle grazing. Consistent with these results, native and exotic annuals were equally abundant in ungrazed mixtures, but exotic species overwhelmingly dominated grazed mixtures. 5. Species able to draw down nitrogen and light to lower levels in monocultures (i.e. those with lower R* values) dominated biomass and seeds in mixed plots without grazers. However, R* did not predict the relative abundance of species in grazed plots. Moreover, the relative abundance of species in mixtures did not correlate with grazing impacts on their monocultures, implying that grazing alters inter-specific competitive dynamics. 6. Synthesis.

Invasive plants often have novel biotic interactions in their introduced ranges. These interactions, including less frequent herbivore attacks, may convey a competitive advantage over native plants. Invasive plants may vary in defence strategies (resistance vs. tolerance) or in response to the type of herbivore (generalists vs. specialists), but no study to date has examined this broad set of traits simultaneously. 2. Here, we examined resistance and tolerance of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) populations from the introduced and native ranges to generalist (Cnidocampa flavescens) and specialist herbivores (Gadirtha inexacta) in the native range. 3. In a field common-garden test of resistance, caterpillars of each species were raised on plants from native and invasive populations. We found the specialist grew larger on and consumed more mass of invasive plant populations than native populations, while the generalist showed the same performance between them. The results were consistent with our laboratory bioassay using excised leaves. Chemical analyses showed that the invasive plants had lower tannin content and higher ratio of carbohydrate to protein than those of their native counterparts, suggesting that plants from invasive populations have altered chemistry that has a larger impact on specialist than on generalist resistance. 4. To test for differences in herbivore tolerance, plants were first defoliated by specialist or generalist herbivory and then allowed to regrow for 100 days in a field common garden. We found that plants from invasive populations had greater herbivore tolerance than native populations, especially for tolerance to generalists. They also grew more rapidly than native counterparts in the absence of herbivory. 5. Synthesis. The results of these experiments indicate that differences in selective pressures between ranges have caused dramatic reductions in resistance to specialist herbivores and those changes in plant secondary chemistry likely underlie these differences. The greater tolerance of invasive populations to herbivory appears to at least partly reflect an increase in growth rate in the introduced range. The greater tolerance to generalist herbivores suggests the intriguing possibility of selection for traits that allow plants to tolerate generalist herbivores more than specialist herbivores.",Web of Science,Triadica sebifera,China;USA,,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

However, few studies have involved invasive species. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of extreme heating (40/35 degrees C for 30 d) on the growth and photosynthesis of an alien invasive species Wedelia trilobata and its indigenous congener (Wedelia chinensis) in South China, and to determine the development of this invasive species and its potential adaptive mechanism. In comparison with W. chinensis, W. trilobata suffered less inhibition of the relative growth rate (RGR) and biomass production due to high temperature, which was consistent with the changes of photosystem II (PSII) activity and net photosynthetic rate (P(n)). High temperature caused a partial inhibition of PSII, but the adverse effect was more severe in W. chinensis. Measurement of the minimum fluorescence (F(o)) versus temperature curves showed that W. trilobata had a higher inflexion temperature of F(o) (T(i)), indicating greater thermostability of the photosynthetic apparatus. Moreover, comparisons of absorbed light energy partitioning revealed that W. trilobata increased xanthophyll-dependent thermal dissipation (Phi(NPQ)) under high temperature, while retaining the higher fraction of absorbed light allocated to photochemistry (Phi(PSII)) relative to W. chinensis. The results suggest that the invasive W. trilobata has a high thermostability of its photosynthetic apparatus and an effective regulating mechanism in energy partitioning of PSII complexes to minimize potential damage and to retain greater capability for carbon assimilation. These factors confer greater heat stress tolerance compared with the native species. Therefore, the invasive W. trilobata may become more aggressive with the increasingly extreme heat climates.",Web of Science,Wedelia trilobata ,China,South China,,,,Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Climate Change,,primary

Interspecific competition significantly reduced Phragmites aboveground biomass, shoot length production, density, and survival by approximately 60%.

It is grown as an ornamental plant, but can also be used as industrial wood. However, in some parts of North America, this species is considered invasive, with high impact on autochthonous populations. We have investigated whether post-fire expansion of this species can be explained at the germination level by analyzing the interaction between physical (light and temperature) and chemical (smoke and nitrogenous compounds) fire-related cues in the regulation of P. tomentosa germination. Light is the key environmental signal in the induction of germination of positively photoblastic P. tomentosa seeds. Smoke, applied in the form of extract (liquid smoke [LS]), stimulates light-induced germination if applied during imbibition, or shortly after the inductive irradiation. This stimulatory effect of LS can be effectively prevented by far-red light, suggesting that the mechanism of smoke action is phytochrome related. The LS had no effect on the germination percentage when applied during the phase of radicle protrusion. However, LS reduced radicle elongation and slowed its protrusion. The LS had no effect on the optimal temperature range of germination (23-27 degrees C). The combined action of LS and KNO(3) in light-induced germination was more effective then when each chemical was applied separately. It can be concluded that all tested components of fire, except elevated temperature, operate to stimulate germination of P. tomentosa seeds, suggesting that the post-fire invasive potential of this species can, at least in part, be explained at the germination level.",Web of Science,Paulownia tomentosa ,USA ; Canada,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Behavioral observations showed that B females were more discriminating than Q females. Males of both species were able to discriminate between mates based on their species and sex, but in general B males discriminated more effectively than Q males. By incorporating these behavioral data into a conceptual model, we show that variation in mating behavior between females of different species was a more significant factor affecting mating than variation between males.

Each of these phases leaves traces in genetic structure, which may affect the species' success in subsequent phases. We examined this interplay of genetic structure and invasion dynamics in the South African Ragwort (Senecio inaequidens), one of Europe's fastest plant invaders. We used AFLP and microsatellite markers to analyze 19 native African and 32 invasive European populations. In combination with historic data, we distinguished invasion routes and traced them back to the native source areas. This revealed that different introduction sites had markedly different success in the three invasion phases. Notably, an observed lag-phase in Northern Germany was evidently not terminated by factors increasing the invasiveness of the resident population but by invasive spread from another introduction centre. The lineage invading Central Europe was introduced to sites in which winters are more benign than in the native source region. Subsequently, this lineage spread into areas in which winter temperatures match the native climate more closely. Genetic diversity clearly increases with population age in Europe and less clearly decreases with spread rate up to population establishment. This indicates that gene flow along well-connected invasion routes counteracted losses of genetic diversity during rapid spread. In summary, this study suggests that multiple introductions, environmental preadaptation and high gene flow along invasion routes contributed to the success of this rapid invader.

Methods We analysed the native-exotic species richness relationship for vascular plants at three spatial scales (small, 0.25 m2 of sample area; medium, 1 m2 of sample area; large, 5 m2 of sample area) in 103 wetlands across Illinois. At each scale, Spearman's correlation coefficient between native and exotic richness was calculated. We also investigated the potential for biotic homogenization by comparing all species surveyed in a wetland community (from the large sample area) with the species composition in all other wetlands using paired comparisons of their Jaccard's and Simpson's similarity indices. Results At large and medium scales, native richness was positively correlated with exotic richness, with the strength of the correlation decreasing from the large to the medium scale; at the smallest scale, the native-exotic richness correlation was negative. The average value for homogenization indices was 0.096 and 0.168, using Jaccard's and Simpson's indices, respectively, indicating that these wetland plant communities have been homogenized because of invasion by exotic species. Main Conclusions Our study demonstrated a clear shift from a positive to a negative native-exotic species richness relationship from larger to smaller spatial scales. The negative native-exotic richness relationship that we found is suggested to result from direct biotic interactions (competitive exclusion) between native and exotic species, whereas positive correlations likely reflect the more prominent influence of habitat heterogeneity on richness at larger scales. Our finding of homogenization at the community level extends conclusions from previous studies having found this pattern at much larger spatial scales.

Methods We examined the diversity and epizootic impact of 384 parasite taxa associated with 22 exotic freshwater invertebrate species.

Results The total number of parasites associated with an exotic host in its native range was about twice that of all parasites associated with it in its entire invaded range.

Changes in behaviour that lead to avoidance are usually displayed by the weaker competitor. In our case though it was the stronger competitor that changed its behaviour by choosing a host for oviposition that was unacceptable to its competitor and avoiding one that was mutually acceptable; this accelerated the displacement of the competitor. We showed this by enclosing both invader (Middle East Asia Minor 1, B biotype) and indigenous (Australia, AN biotype) members of Bemisia tabaci species complex (sap sucking insects known as whiteflies) into field cages with either two plants that were a mutually acceptable oviposition host or one host that was acceptable to both and the other acceptable to the invader only. When only the mutually acceptable host was available, invader and indigenous females oviposited equally across the two plants. However, when given the choice, adult invaders still distributed themselves evenly across both hosts, but shifted their oviposition away from the mutually acceptable host and instead laid mostly on the host poorly utilized by the indigenous competitor.

We test whether biotic resistance may still operate at a more local scale by assessing whether ecological impacts are proportional to habitat suitability for A. gracilipes, as well as to the competitiveness of the invaded ant community. The abundance and species richness of native ants were consistently greater in uninfested than infested plots but the magnitude of the impacts did not differ between habitats.

Differences in the relative abundance of ant functional groups between infested and uninfested sites reflected impacts according to ant size classes and ecology.

Yet the role of disturbance in plant invasions may be less predictable than often assumed, due to the influence of environmental stochasticity and interactions between disturbance regimes. We evaluated the single and interactive effects of prescribed burning (large-scale, infrequent event) and animal diggings (small-scale, frequent events) on the invasion success of Gleditsia triacanthos L. in a tussock grassland relict of the Inland Pampa, Argentina. Tree seedling emergence and survival were monitored over 4 years, after adjusting for propagule pressure through copious seed addition to all disturbance treatments. Burning altered community structure by suppressing tussock grasses and promoting exotic forbs, whereas simulated, armadillo-like diggings had little impact on herbaceous composition. Overall, seedling emergence rather than survival represented the main demographic bottleneck for tree invasion. Tree establishment success varied among seedling cohorts emerged in different climatic years. In a dry year, emergence was only slightly affected by disturbances. In contrast, for two consecutive wet years, initial burning and armadillo-like diggings exerted strong, antagonistic effects on tree recruitment. Whereas fire alone increased recruitment, the simulated burrowing regime prevented seedling emergence in both burned and unburned plots. The latter effect might be explained by reduced soil moisture, and increased seed burial and predation in excavated patches. Thus, the impact of a single, large-scale perturbation promoting woody plant invasion was overridden by a regime of small-scale, frequent disturbances.

This phenomenon has been demonstrated as a major cause of biodiversity alterations, which has prompted scientists to provide explanations for the success or failure of biological invasions. Crepidula fornicata is a gastropod native from the East coast of North America which has successfully invaded many European bays and estuaries since the 19th century, with some noticeable exceptions. Its spread over Europe has been explained by a combination of human-mediated transport and natural dispersal through its long-lived planktonic larva. We here investigated whether larval supply may explain the failure in the proliferation of this species within a particular bay, the Bay of Morlaix (France). Patterns of larval distribution and larval size structure were analysed over ten sites sampled three times (20 July, 4 August and 21 August 2006), regarding characteristics of the adult population and environmental features. Our results evidenced a strong spatial structure in both larval abundance and size at the bay scale, even if larval abundances were low. In this scheme, the location of spawning adults played a critical role, with high numbers of early larvae above the main spawning location. The larval size structure further showed that settlement-stage larvae were rare, which suggested that released larvae might have been exported out of the bay. The use of an analytical model aimed to study the effect of tidal currents on the potential for larval exportation confirmed that larval retention within the bay might be low. The limitation in larval supply resulting from the interactions between spawning location and local hydrodynamics may thus impede the proliferation of this species which is well established for more than 50 years. This study provided an example of factors which may explain the failure of the transition between two major steps of biological invasions, i.e. sustainable establishment and proliferation.",Web of Science,Crepidula fornicata,France,,Bay of Morlaix,,,Field - Observational,estuarine,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,herbivore

We hypothesized that the occurrence of patches of invasion may be related to two interacting factors, the presence of dense understory shrub layers and the presence of thick litter layers on the forest floor. Seeds of M. vimineum were sown in plots located under or distant from Lindera benzoin (spicebush) shrubs, and with or without litter manipulations (none, half of natural amount, naturally occurring amount, double the natural amount) in a mature forest in central New Jersey, USA. Populations were monitored for germination and survivorship, as well as growth and fecundity of surviving plants. Neither shrub-associated shade nor litter depth affected seed germination, but both factors affected survivorship, growth and reproduction. The presence of shade from the shrubs reduced survivorship and seed set. Seeds germinating on top of the litter layer also experience higher mortality than seeds germinating under litter and in contact with soil. These results suggest that the interacting effects of shade from understory strata and deep litter layers may limit the spread of M. vimineum.

The marmot's subsequent occupation of the southern Pyrenees has been extremely fast. From an initial population of similar to 400 individuals, the present population in the southern Pyrenees is estimated to be of more than 10,000 individuals. The objective of this study was to assess what were the mechanisms that have enabled such a fast occupation of the territory. We studied habitat preferences and habitat selection of the alpine marmot in the southern Pyrenees both at the micro- and meso-scale, and compared our results with similar data in the bibliography on their native region. We also compared climatic data from both the native and introduction sites. Our results indicate relatively low climate (precipitation and temperature) matching between the two sites but a relatively high habitat matching. Marmots negatively select high woody cover and the presence of conifers in their home range, while they choose alpine and sub-alpine meadows close to rivers with boulders. Furthermore, the marmot population is independent of snow cover duration. We conclude that the successful establishment in the Pyrenees by the alpine marmot is explained both by the habitat- and climate-matching mechanisms. In both aspects, marmots show a generalist response.

Such damage may be more likely for exotics with close native relatives in the invaded area, since shifts of enemies should be more likely among closely related hosts. In this study, we evaluated whether exotics experience less herbivore damage than natives, and whether phylogenetically novel exotics experience less damage that those that are more closely related to locally occurring family members. Foliar damage was measured on 20 native and 15 exotic Asteraceae that co-occur locally in southern Ontario, Canada. The phylogenetic structure of this damage was quantified using an eigenvector decomposition method, and the relationship between damage and phylogenetic novelty of exotics was evaluated based on phylogenetic distances to other locally occurring Asteraceae. Our results show that 32% of the variation in damage was explained by phylogenetic relationship; similarity in damage tended to be associated with tribes. As predicted, exotics experienced lower damage than native species, even when the dataset was corrected for phylogenetic nonindependence. Contrary to our prediction, however, exotics that were more phylogenetically isolated from locally occurring relatives did not experience less damage. These results suggest that, though exotic Asteraceae may escape many of their natural enemies, this is not in general more likely for species phylogenetically distant from locally occurring native confamilials.",Web of Science,Many,Canada,Ontario,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Enemy Release,,primary

Native species are replaced with widespread non-native species and ants are among the world's most notorious invaders. To date, all documented cases of ant invasions involve exotic introduced species that are spread around the world by human-mediated dispersal. I investigated the effect of urbanization on the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant species, the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say). Colony social structure, life history traits, and the spatial pattern of nest distribution were compared by sampling T. sessile across a gradient of three distinct habitats: natural, semi-natural, and urban. Results demonstrate a remarkable transition in colony social and spatial structure and life history traits between natural and urban environments. In natural habitats, T. sessile colonies are comprised of small, monogyne (single queen), and monodomous (single nest) colonies. In urban areas, T. sessile often exhibit extreme polygyny and polydomy, form large supercolonies, and become a dominant pest. Results also suggest that urban T. sessile colonies may have a negative impact on native ant abundance and diversity. In the natural environment T. sessile coexisted with a wide array of other ant species, while very few ant species were present in the urban environment invaded by T. sessile. Habitat degradation and urbanization can lead to extreme changes in social and spatial colony structure and life history traits in a native ant species and can promote the evolution of invasive characteristics such as polygyny, polydomy, and supercolonial colony structure.",Web of Science,Tapinoma sessile,Europe,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,omnivore

To test the hypothesis that an increase in nitrogen would result in a greater increase in biomass for an alien annual grass than for various indigenous plant functional groups, we conducted a field study in Western Cape Renosterveld shrubland fragments, surrounded by wheat or vinyards, to assess alien grass abundance in relation to soil nitrogen availability. Significant decreases in invasive annual grass Avena fatua cover and soil nitrogen were observed from the edges to the interior of Renosterveld habitat fragments and there was a significant positive relationship between Avena fatua cover and soil nitrogen. In addition, Avena fatua was grown in competition with three indigenous species of different functional types, an annual forb (Dimorphotheca pluvialis), a geophyte (Oxalis purpurea) and an indigenous perennial grass (Tribolium uniolae) at three concentrations of soil nitrogen in a pot experiment. Results revealed that the alien grass Avena fatua had significant increases in biomass when nitrogen was added, whereas the indigenous species did not. Alien grass competition significantly influenced performance of the annual forb and the indigenous grass but did not affect the geophyte.

We evaluated biological and ecological traits with principal coordinate analysis and classification trees. Invasive and imperiled crayfishes occupied different positions in multivariate trait space, although crayfishes invasive at different scales (extraregional vs. extralimital) were also distinct. Extraregional crayfishes (large, high fecundity, habitat generalists) were most distinct from imperiled crayfishes (small, low fecundity, habitat specialists), thus supporting the *two sides of the same coin* hypothesis. Correct classification rates for assignment of crayfishes as invasive or imperiled were high (70-80%), even when excluding the highly predictive but potentially confounding trait of range size (75-90%). We identified a number of species that, although not currently listed as imperiled or found outside their native range, possess many of the life-history and ecological traits characteristic of currently invasive or imperiled taxa.

In contrast, the herbivore community on S. virgaurea consisted predominately of five native insects: two lepidopteran leaf chewers and three dipteran leaf miners.

We found the species well-established within natural environments. The mean annual rate of spread of the invasion (7.94 +/- A 2.99 m/year) was relatively low compared to other studies, suggesting that resistance posed by native ants in natural environments with no or low human disturbance might delay (although not prevent) the spread of the invasion irrespectively of the land-use type. Factors related to the distance to urban areas and characteristics of native and introduced populations explained the rate of spread of the invasion, while habitat-related variables determined the distribution of native ants and the impact of the Argentine ant on them. Native ant communities became more homogeneous following the invasion due to the decline of species richness and abundance. Only few species (Plagiolepis pygmaea and Temnothorax spp.) were able to cope with the spread of the invasion, and were possibly favored by the local extinction of other ant species.

For both ranges separately, we selected suites of the most parsimonious logistic regression models of occurrence based on environmental variables and evaluated these against independent data. We then incorporated information from both ranges in a simple Bayesian model to predict the potential US distribution. Occurrence of A. altissima in both ranges exhibited a unimodal response to temperature variables. In China, occurrence had negative relationships with topographic wetness and forest cover and positive relationships with precipitation and agricultural and urban land use.

The Bayesian model identified 58-80% of 10-arc minute grid cells in the conterminous US as containing suitable areas for A. altissima. The best model developed from Chinese data applied to the US matched most areas of observed occurrence but under-predicted occurrence in lower probability areas. This discrepancy is suggestive of a broadening of the ecological niche of A. altissima and may be due to such factors as less intense competition, increased potency of allelopathy, and novel genotypes formed from multiple introductions.

Population growth rate of this species is especially high in N-rich habitats, and it produces a variety of N-based compounds that have been shown to interfere with the growth and reproduction of native plants. To investigate how increases and shifts in forms of N will impact A. petiolata, seedlings were transplanted to the greenhouse from the field and grown in sand culture.

Plants were measured throughout the growing season and a final harvest yielded measures of biomass and tissue quality. Plant growth increased significantly in response to increased concentration of total N. These increases were similar for all combinations of N. This flexibility in uptake ability may facilitate the invasion of this species, not only by increasing the range of habitats A. petiolata can occupy but also by enhancing N uptake that can lead to the production of secondary compounds disrupting other species' belowground mutualisms.

We found that (1) exotic richness and cover generally increased as fire severity and time since fire increased; (2) the exotic species present in a plot before the fire were also largely present in the plot postfire, regardless of fire severity; (3) most of the new postfire species in a plot were present elsewhere in the study area before the fire, although some new species were truly new invaders that were not found in prefire surveys; (4) lightly burned riparian forests were not more susceptible to exotic invasion than surrounding uplands that burned with similar severity; and (5) native and exotic richness and cover were positively correlated or uncorrelated for all fire severities and years. Our findings indicate that exotics were stimulated by the Hayman Fire, especially in severely burned areas. However, exotic richness and cover remain low as of 2007, and correlations between native and exotic richness and cover suggest that exotics have not yet interfered with native understory development. Therefore, we conclude that exotic plants are not a major ecological threat at present, but recommend that monitoring be continued to evaluate if they will pose a threat in future years.",Web of Science,Many,United States,Colorado,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Coniferous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Among the six populations, Nanjing population showed the highest allele number, allele richness and gene diversity, which is consistent with records indicating Nanjing may be the first site of introduction. In all six populations, significant heterozygote deficit was observed, suggesting founder effects and non-random mating. Analysis of bottleneck under infinite allele model, stepwise mutation model and two-phased model of mutation revealed evidence of a recent bottleneck in all these populations.

This study evaluated the influence of wildfire on A. donax invasion by investigating its relative rate of reestablishment versus native riparian species after wildfire burned 300 ha of riparian woodlands along the Santa Clara River in southern California in October 2003. Post-fire A. donax growth rates and productivity were compared to those of native woody riparian species in plots established before and after the fire. Arundo donax resprouted within days after the fire and exhibited higher growth rates and productivity compared to native riparian plants. Arundo donax grew 3-4 times faster than native woody riparian plants-up to a mean of 2.62 cm day(-1)-and reached up to 2.3 m in height less than 3 months after the fire. One year post-fire, A. donax density was nearly 20 times higher and productivity was 14-24 times higher than for native woody species. Three mechanisms-fire-adapted phenology, high growth rate, and growth response to nutrient enrichment-appear to promote the preemption of native woody riparian species by A. donax after fire. This greater dominance of A. donax after wildfire increased the susceptibility of riparian woodlands along the Santa Clara River to subsequent fire, potentially creating an invasive plant-fire regime cycle. Moreover, A. donax infestations appear to have allowed the wildfire to cross the broad bed of the Santa Clara River from the north, allowing thousands of acres of shrubland to the south to burn.",Web of Science,Arundo donax,United States,California,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Yet few comparisons of reproductive isolation have been carried out to understand how different mechanisms prevent or promote invasions involving hybridization. Here we present a study of prezygotic and postzygotic isolation between non-native red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) and native blacktail shiner (C. venusta stigmatura) from the Coosa River basin (USA) to better understand the formation and expansion of invasive hybrid swarms. We conducted spawning trials to measure mating preferences and raised broods from crosses to assay hybrid viability through early juvenile development. Females of both species were more responsive to conspecific mates, although blacktail shiner females responded more often to heterospecific mates than did red shiner females. Fecundity of red shiner females was also higher than blacktail shiner females. Heterospecific crosses resulted in lower fertilization and egg hatching rates, but we found no other evidence of inviability. Rather, we found comparatively low larval mortality of F(1) hybrids, which is suggestive of heterosis. These findings support prior inferences of assortative mating from genetic descriptions of hybridization, and that the invasion in the Coosa River is likely proceeding due to interspecific competition and intrinsic hybrid viability.",Web of Science,Cyprinella lutrensis,USA,,Coosa River,,,Field - Observational,lotic,,Invasion Hyp.,Hybridization,,herbivore

The study of invasiveness typically emphasizes early successional life-history traits in exotic plants, which enable the capture of high resources in disturbed environments and rapid growth. A key issue in invasion dynamics is whether such behaviours come at the expense of traits such as low-light survivorship, which allow species to become more dominant later in succession. 2. We used maximum-likelihood analysis to compare the growth and survivorship of two exotic trees, Ailanthus altissima and Acer platanoides, with nine dominant native tree species in closed-canopy forests in Connecticut, USA. Growth was modelled as a function of light and survivorship as a function of recent growth; combining models yielded estimates of light-dependent mortality. 3. The exotic species had strikingly high growth rates, exceeding all native species at light levels >= 10% full sun, and growing 2.6 times faster than the fastest-growing native species at 80% full sun. At low-light levels (< 3% full sun), however, growth rates of five native species exceeded both exotics. Exotic species survivorship (as a function of light-driven growth) was strongly dependent on the degree of shading: at 1% full sun, the annual mortality rate of A. platanoides was 10% and A. altissima was 17%; only two native species had higher mortalities. However, at 5% full sun, A. platanoides' mortality was < 1%, superior to all but three native species. Mortality of all species dropped to < 1% by 10% full sun, except A. altissima whose mortality remained high at c. 10%. 4. A life-history trade-off analysis (based on radial growth, height allometry and low-light survivorship) shows a nearly linear trade-off for most species. The native species and Ailanthus follow the common life-history trade-off of low-light survivorship vs. high-light growth. However, A. platanoides diverges from this trade-off pattern by combining very high growth rates with moderately high shade tolerance. 5. Simulations with SORTIE-ND (a forest dynamics model) indicate that poor survivorship of A. altissima will limit it to disturbed sites, whereas A. platanoides' unusual combination of traits makes it invasive in both disturbed and undisturbed forests. Overall, native shade-tolerant trees and slow stand dynamics make undisturbed forests highly resistant to invasion by exotic trees that are intolerant of shade. 6. Synthesis. This study showcases the importance of rapid growth in invasive plants, holding even for exotic tree species known to invade established forests. For A. altissima, high growth rates were accompanied by poor low-light survivorship. A. platanoides departs from the general trade-off pattern that exists among native species and A. altissima, and consequently it can be highly invasive in closed-canopy forests.",Web of Science,Ailanthus altissima;Acer platanoides,USA,Connecticut,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Rapid Growth,primary

The potential invasive success of exotic plant species is thought to be associated with similarity in climate and biome between the original and novel range. We tested this assumption by quantifying the match between the realized climatic niches and biomes occupied in the exotic and native range of 26 plant species introduced to Australia. We then explored correlations between the propensity to shift climatic niche with residence time, invasion status, geographic range size, and species traits. 2. Occurrence data from the native and exotic range of 26 species introduced to Australia were obtained, and the overlap between native and exotic climate niches was calculated using between-class analysis. Shifts into novel biomes were assessed using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Correlations between introduction, distribution and species traits and the degree of climate matching were examined using nonparametric statistical tests. 3. Exotic species frequently occurred in climatic conditions outside those occupied in their native range (20 of 26 species). Nineteen species inhabited biomes in Australia not occupied in the native range and in some instances this shift represented the establishment of populations in novel biomes not present in the native range. No single-species trait, introduction or distributional characteristic was significantly associated with the degree of climatic niche shift. 4.Synthesis. Exotic species are able to occupy climate niches in the new range that differ substantially from those of the native range, and generally do not show biome conservatism between their native and introduced ranges. This implies that novel climatic conditions are not a major obstacle for exotic species establishing populations outside their native range. These results have important implications for the use and interpretation of ecological niche models used to predict the distribution of species in novel climates in time or space. The results also highlight the importance of alternate mechanisms, such as enemy release, phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution, in the establishment of naturalized and invasive populations.",Web of Science,Many,Australia,,,,,Field - Observational;Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General;Climate Change,,primary

Introduced plants have the potential to rapidly evolve traits of ecological importance that may add to their innate potential to become invasive. During invasions, selection may favour genotypes that are already pre-adapted to conditions in the new habitat and, over time, alter the characteristics of subsequent generations. 2. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) occurs in two predominantly spatially separated cytotypes in its native range (Europe-Western Asia), but currently only the tetraploid form has been confirmed in the introduced range (North America), where it is invasive. We used several common garden experiments to examine, across multiple populations, whether tetraploids and diploids from the native range differ in life cycle, leaf traits and reproductive capacity and if such differences would explain the predominance of tetraploids and their advance into new habitats in the introduced range. We also compared the same traits in tetraploids from the native and introduced range to determine whether any rapid adaptive changes had occurred since introduction that may have enhanced invasive potential of the species in North America. 3. We found tetraploids had lower specific leaf area, less lamina dissection and fewer, narrower leaves than diploids. Diploids exhibited a monocarpic life cycle and produced few if any accessory rosettes. Diploids produced significantly more seeds per capitulum and had more capitula per plant than tetraploids. In contrast, the vast majority of European tetraploids continued to flower in both seasons by regenerating from multiple secondary rosettes, demonstrating a predominantly polycarpic life cycle. 4. During early growth tetraploids from North America achieved greater biomass than both tetraploids and diploids from the native range but this did not manifest as larger above-ground biomass at maturity. In North American tetraploids there was also evidence of a shift towards a more strictly polycarpic life cycle, less leaf dissection, greater carbon investment per leaf, and greater seed production per capitulum. 5.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the characteristics of tetraploid C. stoebe pre-adapted them (compared to diploid conspecifics) for spread and persistence of the species into habitats in North America characterized by a more continental climate. After the species' introduction, small but potentially important shifts in tetraploid biology have occurred that may have contributed significantly to successful invasion.",Web of Science,Centaurea stoebe,USA,,,,,Garden,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

Root enzymes that destroy phenolics may protect plants against allelopathic inhibition and thus may aid in invasiveness. Phenolic-degrading enzymes are chiefly found in aboveground plant parts, but have also been previously reported in root tissues where the enzyme's function is unknown. We explored phenolic oxidase activity in emerging roots of grasses in a survey across different grass genera; in particular, we aimed to test whether grasses of the genus Bromus, known for their large invasion potential, differ in this respect from other grass taxa. Methods: We assayed a range of grass genera commonly found in the United States for root enzyme activity with spectrophotometric assays of phenol oxidase activity using L-DOPA as the main substrate. Key results: In the survey of a grass genera, we discovered that roots of the genus Bromus contain large amounts of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, while all other tested grass genera, even ones closely related to Bromus, did not. PPO was found to be present at germination and remained active throughout the life of the plant. Compared to other PPOs, the enzyme present in Bromus appears to have a narrow substrate range. Conclusions: The specific functions of the root PPO and the ecological ramifications of the special status of Bromus are not yet clear.

Methods We analysed alien and native plant richness and fitted generalized additive models in a multimodel-inference framework with comprehensive randomizations to evaluate the relative contribution of environmental and human correlates in explaining the observed patterns. Results Native and alien richness are positively correlated, but different variables influence their spatial patterns. For natives, human population density is the most important factor and is negatively related to richness. Numbers of natives are unexpectedly lower in areas with a high proportion of natural land cover (probably attributable to local farming practices) and, to a lesser degree, affected by the movement of the coastline. On the other hand, alien species richness is strongly related to climatic factors, and more aliens are found in sectors with high rainfall.

Location South-West Iberian Peninsula. Methods Hybrids were characterized using chloroplast and nuclear DNA, and ploidy assessments. The ecological tolerance of the hybrids was studied using vegetation surveys and transplant experiments. Results We found that both parental species have been seed parents to hybrids and that all hybrids had an additive pattern of species-specific nuclear markers consistent with F(1) hybrids.

Methods We used ordinary least-squares regressions and quantile regressions for analysing the relationship between the occupancy frequency of alien species in the sampled grid and their phylogenetic distance to the native species pool. Results Alien species with high occupancy frequency in the sampled grid are, on average, more phylogenetically related to native species than are less frequent aliens, although this relationship is significant only for archaeophytes. In addition, as shown by the quantile regressions, the relationship between phylogenetic relatedness to the native flora and occupancy frequency is much stronger for the most frequent aliens than for rare aliens.

We examined the relationship of presence and abundance of Eurasian Collared Doves Streptopelia decaocto to environmental factors using recent data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to understand factors influencing its expansion into the continental USA. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model was used to account for excess zero observations because this species was not observed on the majority of survey routes, despite its large geographical range. Model fit was improved when we included environmental covariates as compared with the null model, which only included distance from the route where this species was first observed. Probability of zero count was positively related to the distance from the first route and road density and was inversely related to minimum temperature and distance to coast. Abundance of the species was positively related to road density and was inversely related to annual precipitation and distance to coast. Random intercept by land-cover type also improved model fit. Model fit was improved with the ZIP model over the standard Poisson model, suggesting that presence and abundance of this species are characterized by different environmental factors. However, overall low accuracy of model-predicted presence/absence and abundance with the independent validation dataset may indicate either that there are other explanatory factors or that there is great uncertainty in the species' colonization process. Our large-scale study provides additional evidence that the range expansion of this species tends to follow human-altered landscapes such as road and agricultural areas as well as responding to general geographical features such as coastlines or thermal clines.

The aim of our study was to characterize its antioxidative system in order to find out if the system underlies the tolerance of S. densiflora to cadmium toxicity. S. densiflora plants were firstly evaluated to ascertain its antioxidative status in the natural habitat and then they were cultured in the laboratory in unpolluted sand for 28 days. Throughout this period, plants acclimatized and oxidative stress markers reached stable low levels. Then, S. densiflora plants were exposed to cadmium concentrations (10, 100 and 1000 mu M Cd) for another 28 days. Higher Cd content in leaves was related to higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing important oxidative cell damage (lipid peroxidation and lower chlorophyll content). However, S. densiflora possesses a well-organized and appropriately modulated antioxidative defense system which comprises enzymatic activities of guaiacol peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11) and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) coupled with the activation of the ascorbate cycle, including enzymatic activities of glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), dehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.8.5.1) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.6.5.4).

Our set of functional traits addresses species' reproductive biology, life history, morphology and ecophysiology. To take account of broad-scale heterogeneity across the country we compared the relative frequencies of neophytes and natives with particular trait attributes at the scale of grid cells (c. 130 km(2) each). Subsequently, we compared the differences at the grid cell scale to the differences in the corresponding comparisons at the scale of the entire country. Finally, we explored how variation in the trait compositions of the non-indigenous species across the country relates to variation in the trait compositions of the natives. We found remarkable differences in the trait compositions of neophytes and natives at the grid cell scale. Neophytes were over-represented in insect- and self-pollinated species and in species with a later and longer flowering season. Furthermore, the proportions of species with mesomorphic or hygromorphic leaf anatomy, of annual herbs and of trees as well as of non-clonals and polyploids were significantly higher in neophytes than in natives. These differences at the grid cell scale could vary distinctly from the corresponding differences observed at the country scale. This result highlights the complexity of the invasion process and suggests an importance of spatial scale for the comparisons. Correlation analysis indicated, that for traits relating to plant morphology and ecophysiology, the relative frequencies of the non-indigenous species increased with those of the natives. This suggests that favourable environments for natives with particular attributes constitute an increased suitability for neophytes with these attributes as well.

At high altitude, mean body size of both sexes and the degree of SSD were significantly reduced; the reduction in mean body size with increasing altitude was more pronounced in females, although not significantly so. Female bullfrogs also showed a significant decrease in average age at high altitude that may be a major factor related to this pattern; average age of male bullfrogs did not vary significantly with altitude.

Here I studied how the allelopathic inhibition of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) seedlings by garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) depended on the presence of a soil microbial community. Using three analytical approaches to quantifying allelopathy, I consistently found allelopathic inhibition only in sterilized soils, suggesting that certain microbial taxa inhibit the process, possibly by degrading the allelochemicals.

Colonization and extinction of M. vimineum patches were followed over three years (2005-2007), and spread rate was estimated using a reaction-diffusion model. Direct seed dispersal from the roadside populations occurred primarily adjacent to the maternal plants, indicating that the disjunct M. vimineum patches within the forest interiors occurred via secondary seed dispersal over longer distances. Patches of M. vimineum were found as far as 45 m into the forest interior, but M. vimineum seed in the seed bank were only found within 10 m of the roadside population. Colonization rates of the forest interiors were significantly higher for the more mesic sites than the more xeric sites. The same trend was noted for the spread rate. Radial spread rates ranged between 0.16 and 0.50 m year(-1) and forest interiors were estimated to become saturated with M. vimineum in anywhere between 10 (more mesic sites) and 59 (more xeric sites) years.

Most alien fruits were small (81% < 15 mm in mean width), and had watery fruit pulps that were high in sugars and low in nitrogen and lipids. When compared to indigenous species, alien fruits had significantly smaller seeds. Further, alien fruit pulps contained more sugar and more variable (and probably greater) nitrogen per pulp wet weight, and species tended to have longer fruiting seasons than indigenous species.

In this study, we investigate fine-scale population genetic structure of invasive Senecio madagascariensis (fireweed) using microsatellite markers to determine levels of genetic diversity and how it pertains to introduction history of this species within and among the Hawaiian Islands. Dispersal patterns were interpreted and, together with a habitat suitability analysis, we aim to describe the potential range expansion of S. madgascariensis within the islands. Bayesian and frequency-based analyses revealed genetic structure with two major genetic demes corresponding to the two fireweed-infested islands of Maui and Hawaii. Both these demes showed further genetic sub-structure, each consisting of three genetically distinct subgroups. Overall, fireweed showed significant levels of inbreeding. Major genetic demes (Maui and Hawaii) differed in observed heterozygosities, inbreeding and genetic structure, each harbouring a large proportion of private alleles. In contrast to the current understanding of fireweed's introduction history between the Hawaiian Islands, fine-scale population genetic parameters suggest that this species has been introduced at least twice, possibly even more, to the archipelago. Spatial analyses also revealed high correlation between genetic similarity and geographical proximity (> 2 km apart) followed by a sharp decline. In addition, a single population was identified that likely resulted from a rare human- or animal-mediated extreme long-distance dispersal event from Maui to Hawaii. Bayesian and likelihood estimates of 'first generation migrants' also concurred that contemporary dispersal occurs more frequently over smaller spatial scales than larger scales. These findings indicate that spread in this species occurs primarily via a stratified strategy. Predictions from habitat suitability models indicate all Hawaiian Islands as highly suitable for fireweed invasion and the movement of propagules to currently uninfested islands and outlying suitable habitats should be avoided to circumvent further expansions of the invasion.",Web of Science,Senecio madagascariensis,USA,Hawaii,,,,,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,primary

We tested whether T. officinale plants from a heterogeneous environment in terms of water availability show greater phenotypic plasticity and better performance in response to experimental water shortage than plants from a less variable environment. This was tested at both low and moderate temperatures in plants from two sites (Corvallis, Oregon, USA, and El Blanco, Balmaceda, Chile) that differ in their pattern of monthly variation in rainfall during the growth season. We compared chlorophyll fluorescence (photosynthetic performance), flowering time, seed output, and total biomass. Plants subjected to drought showed delayed flowering and lower photosynthetic performance. Plants from USA, where rainfall variation during the growth season was greater, exhibited greater plasticity to water shortage in photosynthetic performance and flowering time than plants from Chile. This was true at both low and moderate temperatures, which were similar to early- and late-season conditions, respectively. However, phenotypic plasticity to decreased water availability was seemingly maladaptive because under both experimental temperatures USA plants consistently performed worse than Chile plants in the low water environment, showing lower total biomass and fewer seeds per flower head.

Species diversity, richness, and abundance were highest in prairie, and were higher in mixed woodland than in S. sebiferum. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling distinguished orders and families of arthropods, and families of herbivores in S. sebiferum from mixed woodland and coastal prairie. Taxonomic similarity between S. sebiferum and mixed woodland was 51%. Fauna from S. sebiferum in 2001 was more similar to mixed woodland than to samples from S. sebiferun collected in 1982.

However, few attempts have ever been made to quantify alien species incidence in different communities along the coastal zonation. This work aims to analyze the distribution of alien plants along the coastal zonation of sandy shores on the Tyrrhenian coast, addressing specifically differences among plant communities in abundance of alien plants. Methods The study was performed on recent dunes (Holocene) of the central western coast of Italy. We selected dune landscapes where invasion processes were particularly evident. Vegetation plots were randomly sampled and through cluster analysis, we identified six plant communities corresponding to the typical zonation described for the Tyrrhenian sandy coast of Central Italy. We evaluated and compared frequency and abundance of invasion in these different communities. Further, we investigated how propagule pressure (measured using as proxy human structures) contributed to the observed invasion patterns. Important Findings We found a relatively low total number of aliens but also a differential distribution pattern and strong abundance of some of the aliens in specific sectors of the vegetation zonation. The perennial community of transition dunes appears most affected by invasion processes, related almost exclusively to the frequent and widespread Carpobrotus aff. acinaciformis. This alien species reaches high cover values, apparently lowering cover of native species of transition dune plant communities. Higher levels of invasion in the transition dune can be partially explained because of greater propagule pressure in this section of the dune profile.

Significant main effects of food density, site, species, and temperature were observed on the probability of food being occupied by a species. However, there were also significant interaction effects, making it impossible to interpret the main effects in isolation. Monomorium sydneyense dominated a smaller proportion of resources in trials with increased resource distribution and cooler temperatures, allowing more species to access resources. 4.

We measured the morphology and attachment strength of Codium over 4 seasons at 3 sites of differing wave exposure and water motion near Halifax, Nova Scotia. The bushiness index (circumference-to-length ratio) of Codium varied inversely with the degree of wave exposure and water motion. Attachment strength was weakly related to thallus morphology (circumference) and generally did not differ between sites and seasons. We examined the effect of morphology on survival of Codium by experimentally trimming the thallus (by cutting 33 or 66% of branches) in a field experiment over 1 year. Trimming, which simulated natural fragmentation, had a positive effect on survival relative to untrimmed controls, particularly at the most wave-exposed site and after a major storm event (Hurricane Juan), and the magnitude of this effect was related to the degree of trimming. We used a flume tank to measure drag forces at different flow velocities (0.3-0.5 m s(-1)) on experimentally trimmed plants (using the same levels of trimming as in the field experiment). Drag was positively related to plant circumference and water velocity, and negatively related to the degree of trimming. Attachment strength of these plants was 10 to 22 times greater than the drag force, suggesting that Codium is dislodged when flow velocities greatly exceed 0.5 m s(-1). The ratio of attachment strength to drag force decreased with circumference, indicating a greater risk of dislodgment with increasing plant size. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Also, the effects of the fungus on plant growth and fitness were studied in a naturally growing population of second-year plants in the field. Powdery mildew significantly reduced growth of first-year plants in the greenhouse, eventually causing complete mortality. Simulated drought slowed both plant growth and disease development, independent of light conditions. In the field, plants with little incidence of disease after their first year grew taller during their second year, producing significantly more siliques and twice as many seeds as heavily diseased plants did. Seed germination rates did not differ between plants with different levels of disease severity. Consistent reductions in survival, growth, and fitness caused by fungal infection may reduce populations of garlic mustard.

Rhododendron ponticum is an ecologically damaging exotic weed in the British Isles, which spreads predominantly by seed. I investigated how inbreeding and outcrossing affect seed production and germination in a wild population of this species in Ireland. Experimental manipulations revealed low fruit and seed set when insects were excluded from flowers, suggesting that this species has limited capability for spontaneous autogamy. Hand-pollination treatments showed that, although flowers are self-compatible (with self and same plant pollen), higher levels of seed set occur following outcrossing (xenogamy). There was no significant difference in rate of germination of seeds from inbred or outcrossed treatments. The addition of xenogamous pollen to open flowers did not increase fruit or seed set, suggesting that flowers in this population are not pollen limited: native generalist pollinators, mainly bumblebees (Bombus spp.), are providing an adequate pollinator service. This work demonstrates that outcrossing increases seed set and pollinators are required to facilitate this. Hence, generalist native pollinators can promote invasion by exotic plants. Native pollinators can clearly play an important part in alien species invasion.

This paper addresses the question of whether a reintroduced population of a critically endangered island endemic, the Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) is competing or co-existing with an exotic congener, the Madagascar fody (F. madagascariensis). We investigated habitat use and feeding ecology of the Mauritius fody during two early phases of its reintroduction onto a restored islet, and compared these parameters with the sympatric population of Madagascar fodies. The number of Mauritius fody territories increased from 4 to 20 in a seven month period following release, and overall mean territory area (c. 1 ha) was significantly larger than that of the more abundant Madagascar fody (c. 0.07 ha). The initial four territories were located in mature coastal forest, whilst those of the Madagascar fody were characterised by open canopy, smaller trees and grass-dominated ground cover. Mauritius fodies foraged mainly in dead leaves for insects, whilst the Madagascar fody fed primarily on the seeds of a native grass species. Mauritius fody territories later expanded to include a range of habitats. Differing ecological requirements indicate that divergence between these congeners may be sufficient for them to coexist and exploit contrasting resources on restored islets. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the long-term restoration of the Mauritius fody and other avian recovery programmes and highlight the critical importance of long-term post-release monitoring to assess the success of reintroduction to offshore islets as a long-term conservation strategy.

Species with multiple reproductive strategies (e.g. mixed-mating system with both self-and cross-fertilization) can be efficient colonizers. Herein we focus on Corella eumyota, an exotic ascidian that has rapidly invaded English Channel coasts in recent years. Interestingly, this brooding hermaphroditic ascidian is capable of self-fertilization in the laboratory. We developed 12 microsatellite markers from an enriched library of genomic DNA to investigate the level of inbreeding and selfing in two putatively native populations (South Africa, N = 34, and New Zealand, N = 28) and to examine if founder effects were possibly associated with its recent introduction in two French populations (Perros-Guirec, N = 22 and Brest; N = 25). Genetic polymorphism was very low in both native populations (i.e. less than 60% of the loci were polymorphic) and even lower in the introduced populations, one of which was monomorphic at all loci, suggesting a recent bottleneck. F is and a new method based on multi-locus heterozygosity were used to provide estimates of inbreeding. A high selfing rate was inferred in the South Africa population with both methods (s = 0.90), whereas in the other native population (New Zealand) a lower but significant estimate of selfing rate (s = 0.29) was obtained with the multi-locus method. This variability of population selfing rate might be explained by a mixed-mating system, allowing C. eumyota to reproduce through inbreeding and outbreeding according to mating possibilities; this trait may have favoured the rapid establishment of new populations in Europe.",Web of Science,Corella eumyota,France,,,,,Field - Observational,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Self Compatible,filter

To analyse whether open stands are due to unsuitable conditions or represent the invading front for further spread, we studied life-cycle, population dynamics, stand structure and soil conditions of open and dense stands over two transition periods. Populations decreased during the first interval but increased after the extremely dry and warm summer of 2003 during the second interval. Open stands had shorter generation times, lower height, smaller proportions of small individuals and were less in equilibrium with the environment than dense stands. In open stands, growth to higher stages was most important, while in dense stands delayed development (self-loops) had a strong effect on population growth; stasis and fecundity contributed most to the difference in lambda between stand types. By petiole extension H. mantegazzianum may raise its leaves just above the resident vegetation. Therefore, younger stages develop faster in open stands, whereas strong competition by conspecific adults leads to longer generation times and a higher proportion of small individuals in dense stands. Disturbance due to extreme climatic conditions in summer 2003 equalised population dynamics of both stand types. Life-cycle variation between stand types makes it difficult to infer simple management rules. However, our data suggest that small and/or open stands of H. mantegazzianum may eventually serve as initials for further spread after land-use changes, whereas dense stands are stable and may represent sources of propagules.",Web of Science,Heracleum mantegazzianum,Germany,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity;Disturbance,,primary

Ironically, these urban environments provide refuges for the native fire ants while adjacent natural habitats have been overrun by invasive fire ants. Resistance to invasive fire ants in these urban areas occurs mainly in older residential properties constructed prior to the S. invicta invasion, while more recent construction has allowed establishment by S. invicta. The invasive ability of S. invicta is often attributed to escape from parasitoids and efficient dispersal of polygyne multiple queen colonies. Here we also show the importance of landscape parameters in the invasion process, where low levels of disturbance and continuous plant cover in older residential areas form possible barriers to colonization. Dense leaf cover (high NDVI) was also found to be associated with native ant refuges.

In this paper, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to explore the clonal diversity and clonal structure of Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms in natural populations, and their possible effects on the plant success as an invader are also discussed. Five populations covering the entire distribution area in China were studied, sampling 43 individuals per population at an interval of I m in a sampling plot. Twelve RAPD primers produced 69 reproducible bands, with 22 being polymorphic. Only five RAPD phenotypes (clones) were detected in these five populations, but each population consisted of at least three clones, contrary to the traditional expectations that E. crassipes populations should be monoclonal. The diversity of clones within populations is thought to be mainly resulted from multiple introductions by humans. The evenness of distribution of clones varied slightly and most clones were widespread, suggesting clonal growth is the predominant mode of regeneration in all the populations. A single clone dominated each population and this clone might be the first one introduced into China or the genotype with a higher phenotypic plasticity, which could survive and reproduce via clonal growth in various habitats. The clones in each population were highly intermixed, especially in river populations, suggesting this species has a guerilla clonal structure which can be facilitated by water current.

Although these strategies were not exclusive to L. humile, their joint use, together with the large number of workers forming each *unicolony,* conferred a clear advantage for resource exploitation. Some native species were more severely affected than others by the presence of L. humile in terms of both abundance and behavior. The worst affected species were those whose ecological cbaracteristics were similar to those of the Argentine ant, e.g., Pheidole pallidula (Nylander, 1849); the species least affected was Cataglyphis floricola Tinaut, 1993, possibly because of its subordinate and thermophilous nature (little overlap of daily activity rhythms with the exotic species).",Web of Science,Linepithema humile,Spain,,Donana National Park,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Coniferous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances,omnivore

First, we tested the hypothesis that the removal of fragments of C. taxifolia from an estuary would be dependent on anchor type (sand versus rock) and anchor attachment (chain versus rope). Second, we hypothesised that the viability of different sized clumps (1, 5 and 10 g dry weight) of C. taxifolia would be dependent on aerial exposure (I h, I day and 3 days) and environmental conditions (sun versus shade, damp rope versus no rope). Fragments of C taxifolia were consistently removed by anchors regardless of the anchor type; overall, 82% of anchors lowered into C. taxifolia beds removed fragments. Rock and sand anchors removed similar sized clumps of C. taxifolia (up to 15 g dry weight), while chain attachments removed significantly larger clumps compared to ropes (up to 0.5 g dry weight). Once removed from the water, fragment survivorship increased with clump size, protection from desiccation (i.e. greatest under damp shaded ropes) and decreased with length of aerial exposure. Most shaded clumps survived I h of aerial exposure, while none, irrespective of their size, survived 3 days.

It is widely considered that phenotypic plasticity is important to species invasiveness. However, few empirical studies have expressly assessed the relationship between species invasiveness and their responses to environmental variability. Thoughtfully incorporating phenotypic plasticity into studies of invasiveness requires explicit links among appropriate environmental variables, traits relevant to invasion success, and comparison groups of species, populations or genotypes (competitors or close relatives) that place focal species in context. 2. We examine trait responsiveness in introduced species of Crepis and Centaurea (Asteraceae) that have been characterized by different degrees of success. Specifically, we assess the extent to which species are robust in the face of harsh environments and opportunistically responsive to favourable conditions. 3. We exposed all species to water and phosphorus availability treatments in a common glasshouse experiment and report the responses of phenological, architectural, size and fitness traits. We predicted that, compared with less invasive congeners, invasive species would more often display robust fitness in harsh environments (here, drought and no phosphorus addition) and would also be more responsive to favourable conditions (no drought and phosphorus additions). 4. In both Crepis and Centaurea we found evidence of greater stress tolerance to low phosphorous among the more invasive congeners, albeit for different components of fitness. Contrary to expectations, we observed no relationship between invasiveness and opportunism. Overall, trait responses were highly variable and largely idiosyncratic with respect to invasive categorization. 5. Consistent with basic expectations, across-environment species performance largely corresponded to degree of invasiveness. 6. Our results suggest that, even among closely related species, relationships between invasiveness and phenotypic plasticity do not necessarily reveal consistent patterns, nor do they conform to simple theoretical expectations. We suspect that phenotypic plasticity may indeed play an important role in many species invasions, but the breadth of relevant factors (which genotypes, which populations, which traits, which environments) reduces the likelihood of detecting robust general patterns.",Web of Science,Centaurea spp.;Crepsis spp.,USA,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary
2894,"Emery, Sarah M.",2007,Limiting similarity between invaders and dominant species in herbaceous plant communities?,journal,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,95,5,1027,1035,"1. Limiting similarity theory predicts that successful invaders should differ functionally from species already present in the community. This theory has been tested by manipulating the functional richness of communities, but not other aspects of functional diversity such as the identity of dominant species. Because dominant species are known to have strong effects on ecosystem functioning, I hypothesized that successful invaders should be functionally dissimilar from community dominants. 2. To test this hypothesis, I added seeds of 17 different species to two different experiments: one in a natural oldfield community that had patches dominated by different plant species, and one in grassland mesocosms that varied in the identity of the dominant species but not in species richness or evenness. I used indicator species analyses to test whether invaders had higher establishment success in plots with functionally different dominant species. 3. A large percentage of invader species (47-71%) in both experiments showed no difference in affinity across the different dominant treatments, although one-third of species did show some evidence for limiting similarity. Exotic invaders had much higher invasion success than native invaders, and seemed to be inhibited by dominant species that were functionally similar. However, even these invasion patterns were not consistent across the two experiments. 4. The results from this study show that there is some evidence that dominant species suppress invasion by functionally similar species, beyond the effect of simple presence or absence of species in communities, although it is not the sole factor affecting invasion success. Patterns of invasion success were inconsistent across species and experiments, indicating that other studies using only a single species of invader to make conclusions about community invasibility should be interpreted with caution.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Michigan,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Empty Niche,,primary

Acer platanoides (Norway maple) is an important non-native invasive canopy tree in North American deciduous forests, where native species diversity and abundance are greatly reduced under its canopy. We conducted a field experiment in North American forests to compare planted seedlings of A. platanoides and Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a widespread, common native that, like A. platanoides, is shade tolerant. Over two growing seasons in three forests we compared multiple components of seedling success: damage from natural enemies, ecophysiology, growth and survival. We reasoned that equal or superior performance by A. platanoides relative to A. saccharum indicates seedling characteristics that support invasiveness, while inferior performance indicates potential barriers to invasion. 2. Acer platanoides seedlings produced more leaves and allocated more biomass to roots, A. saccharum had greater water use efficiency, and the two species exhibited similar photosynthesis and first-season mortality rates. Acer platanoides had greater winter survival and earlier spring leaf emergence, but second-season mortality rates were similar. 3. The success of A. platanoides seedlings was not due to escape from natural enemies, contrary to the enemy release hypothesis. Foliar insect herbivory and disease symptoms were similarly high for both native and non-native, and seedling biomass did not differ. Rather, A. platanoides compared well with A. saccharum because of its equivalent ability to photosynthesize in the low light herb layer, its higher leaf production and greater allocation to roots, and its lower winter mortality coupled with earlier spring emergence. Its only potential barrier to seedling establishment, relative to A. saccharum, was lower water use efficiency, which possibly could hinder its invasion into drier forests. 4. The spread of non-native canopy trees poses an especially serious problem for native forest communities, because canopy trees strongly influence species in all forest layers. Success at reaching the canopy depends on a tree's ecology in previous life-history stages, particularly as a vulnerable seedling, but little is known about seedling characteristics that promote non-native tree invasion. Experimental field comparison with ecologically successful native trees provides insight into why non-native trees succeed as seedlings, which is a necessary stage on their journey into the forest canopy.",Web of Science,Acer platanoides,USA,New Jersey,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,primary

We investigated whether plants originating from southern Europe and recently established in north-western Europe experience less soil pathogen effects than native species. 2. We selected three plant species originating from southern Europe that have immigrated into the Netherlands and three similar native Dutch species. All six plant species were grown in sterilized soils with a soil inoculum collected from the rhizospheres of field populations. As a control we grew a series of all six plant species with a sterilized rhizosphere inoculum. 3. We harvested the plants, added the conditioned soil to sterilized soil and grew a second generation of all six plant species in order to test for each plant pair feedback effects from the conditioned soil communities to conspecifics and heterospecifics. 4. The effect of the soil community is dependent on plant species, and is dependent on soil fertility in only one of the three pairs. 5. Soil conditioning caused less biomass reduction to exotic plant species than to native species, suggesting that exotic immigrants are less exposed to soil pathogens than similar native plant species. 6. Our results suggest that plant species that expand their range as a result of climate change may become released from soil pathogenic activity. Whether the exotics are released from soil pathogens, or whether they experience enhanced benefit from mutualistic symbionts remains to be studied. We conclude that range expansion may result in enemy release patterns that are similar to artificially introduced invasive exotic plant species. 7. The escape from enemies through range shifts changes key biotic interactions and complicates predictions of future distribution and dominance.",Web of Science,Heracleum mantegazzianum;Tragopogon dubius;Eragrostis pilos,Netherlands,,,,,Garden,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Climate Change,,primary

A high-effort trapping design revealed highly leptokurtic dispersal distributions, with seeds caught up to 96 m from the source, far further than mean dispersal distances (approx. 2m). Nonparametric wave speed estimates are highly sensitive to sampling effort. Mechanistic estimates are insensitive to sampling because they are obtained from independent data and more useful because they are based on the dispersal mechanism. Over a wide range of realistic conditions, mechanistic spread rate estimates were most sensitive to high winds and low seed settling velocities.

Although it has been suggested that salinity limits the invasive success of mosquitofish, there are few studies on how salinity affects its ecology. We examined differences in life history traits of mosquitofish at 19 sampling sites from fresh (438 mu S/cm; ca. 0.2 parts per thousand of salinity) to polysaline waters (35.1 mS/cm; ca. 23 parts per thousand). Salinity affected the density and life history traits of both male and female mosquitofish; density showed a unimodal response to salinity, stronger for females and thus affecting the sex ratio. On the other hand, the endemic Aphanius iberus was only present in polysaline and eusaline waters, where mosquitofish were generally absent. Mosquitofish increased reproductive investment (higher gonadal mass) in oligosaline waters, at the cost of somatic condition in females. The increase in reproductive investment also implied an increase in total mass in contrast to somatic mass, demonstrating that the latter is a better indicator of condition. Females from higher salinity waters presented more embryos in advanced developmental stages, indicating earlier reproduction than in fresh water. After correction for brood and fish sizes, females from saltier environments presented heavier embryos (independently of maturation state). In summary, salinity mainly affected mosquitofish females which, despite presenting earlier maturation and higher reproductive investment, reduced their condition and density, hence supporting the hypothesis that salinity limits mosquitofish invasive success.

In this case invaders should present combinations of life-history traits that give them higher competitive ability than residents, even at the expense of lower colonization ability. We test this prediction by comparing life-history traits among four fruit fly species, one endemic and three successive invaders, in La Reunion Island. Recent invaders tend to produce fewer, but larger, juveniles, delay the onset but increase the duration of reproduction, survive longer, and senesce more slowly than earlier ones. These traits are associated with higher ranks in a competitive hierarchy established in a previous study.

Enigmatically, mutualistic organisms are often successful in colonizing novel environments even though they commonly persist only through intricate relationships with other species. Mutualistic ants, for example, protect aphids from natural enemies while collecting carbohydrate-rich honeydew. To facilitate this interaction, ants have evolved aggressive responses to aphid alarm pheromone emissions. As invasive and native mutualists have not evolved together, however, it is unclear if this form of cross-species communication exists between these two parties thereby facilitating these novel interactions. We address this hypothesis by assessing whether the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, responds to native poplar aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, alarm signals. Here, we show that interspecific signalling does exist in this newly established mutualistic interaction. Argentine ant workers exhibit increased aggression and double the number of visits to an aphid colony after an aphid alarm signal is emitted.

Understanding complex and potentially interacting factors that are common in urban and agricultural landscapes and underlie rapid invasions requires an experimental, factorial approach. We tested the effects of flooding and nutrient and sediment additions (3 x 3 x 3 = 27 treatments, plus a control with no additions) on invasion of Phalaris into mesocosms containing wet prairie vegetation. We discovered a three-step invasion and degradation process: (1) initially, resident native species declined with prolonged flooding and sediment additions, and (2) prolonged flooding, sedimentation, and nutrients accelerated Phalaris aboveground growth; biomass rose to 430 times that of the control within just two growing seasons. The dramatic expansion of Phalaris in the second year resulted in the formation of monospecific stands in over one-third of the treatments, as (3) native species continued their decline in year 2. Disturbances acted alone and in combination to make the resident wetland community more invasible and Phalaris more aggressive, leading to monospecific stands. Yet, Phalaris did not always *win*: under the least disturbed conditions, the resident plant canopy remained dense and vigorous and Phalaris remained small. When anthropogenic disturbances coincide with increases in the gross supply of resources, more tolerant, fast-growing, and morphologically plastic plants like Phalaris can invade very rapidly.

These three exotic species, or *exotic triad,* may impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby-ruffe competition experiment simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding, along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels.

Additionally, the population also lacked significant genetic structuring with no patterns of regional differentiation or isolation by distance.

Rapid spread and interrupted distribution patterns of introduced plant species indicate long-distance dispersal along roads. The extent to which this process is due to species' migration along linear habitats or alternatively, to seed transport by vehicles has not yet been tested systematically. We tested this by sampling seeds inside long motorway tunnels to exclude nontraffic dispersal. Vehicles transported large amounts of seeds. The annual seed rain caused by vehicles on the roadsides of five different tunnel lanes within three tunnels along a single urban motorway in Berlin, Germany, ranged from 635 to 1579 seeas/m(2)/year Seeds of non-native species accounted for 50.0% of the 204 species and 54.4% of the total 11,818 seeds trapped inside the tunnels. Among the samples were 39 (19.1%) highly invasive species that exhibit detrimental effects on native biodiversity in some parts of the world. By comparing the flora in the tunnel with that adjacent to the tunnel entrances we confirmed long-distance dispersal events (>250 m) for 32.3% of the sampled species. Seed sources in a radius of 100 m around the entrances of the tunnels had no significant effect on species richness and species composition of seed samples from inside the tunnels, indicating a strong effect of long-distance dispersal by vehicles. Consistently, the species composition of the tunnel seeds was more similar to the regional roadside flora of Berlin than to the local flora around the tunnel entrances. Long-distance dispersal occurred significantly more frequently in seeds of non-native (mean share 38.5%) than native species (mean share 4.1%).

It produces large amount of achenes which are highly heterogeneous in size. Due to the preponderant role of propagules in invasive plant processes, the achene mass variability related to germination, dispersal strategy and life history traits of offspring were investigated within this species. Methods: The variability in achene mass was quantified among six populations sampled in different habitats. The effects of achene mass variation on germination were studied. The percentages of floating and non-floating achenes were evaluated in the studied populations. The consequences of floatability on the growth and traits of the offspring were studied. Key Results: Mean achene mass ranged from 1.72 to 3.60 mg, depending on the populations, and was highly variable. Variation among achenes within plants accounted for 63-9 % of the variance, whereas variances among plants within each population (22.2 %) and among populations (13.9 %) were lower. Achene masses were also positively correlated to the total germination percentage for four populations out of six. Two kinds of achenes were distinguished: floating and non-floating. The majority of floating achenes (90 %) sank 24 It after water immersion. Whatever the population, floating achenes were lighter, more dormant and germinated faster than non-floating achenes. Plants which issued from floating achenes had better growth than those from non-floating achenes. Conclusions: The capacity of A. artemisiifolia to be invasive in Europe appears to be high, possibly due to its huge plasticity in seed mass which may help it to cope with a wide range of conditions and to establish in disturbed habitats. Furthermore, the recent invasion of southern France by A. artemisiifolia could be partially explained by water dispersal of achenes through rivers and has pinpointed its colonization potential along French rivers.",Web of Science,Ambrosia artemisiifolia,France,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Plasticity,,primary

The cultivation and dissemination of alien ornamental plants increases their potential to invade. More specifically, species with bird-dispersed seeds can potentially infiltrate natural nucleation processes in savannas. 2. To test (i) whether invasion depends on facilitation by host trees, (ii) whether propagule pressure determines invasion probability, and (iii) whether alien host plants are better facilitators of alien fleshy-fruited species than indigenous species, we mapped the distribution of alien fleshy-fruited species planted inside a military base, and compared this with the distribution of alien and native fleshy-fruited species established in the surrounding natural vegetation. 3. Abundance and diversity of fleshy-fruited plant species was much greater beneath tree canopies than in open grassland and, although some native fleshy-fruited plants were found both beneath host trees and in the open, alien fleshy-fruited plants were found only beneath trees. 4. Abundance of fleshy-fruited alien species in the natural savanna was positively correlated with the number of individuals of those species planted in the grounds of the military base, while the species richness of alien fleshy-fruited taxa decreased with distance from the military base, supporting the notion that propagule pressure is a fundamental driver of invasions. 5. There were more fleshy-fruited species beneath native Acacia tortilis than beneath alien Prosopis sp. trees of the equivalent size. Although there were significant differences in native plant assemblages beneath these hosts, the proportion of alien to native fleshy-fruited species did not differ with host. 6. Synthesis. Birds facilitate invasion of a semi-arid African savanna by alien fleshy-fruited plants, and this process does not require disturbance. Instead, propagule pressure and a few simple biological observations define the probability that a plant will invade, with alien species planted in gardens being a major source of propagules. Some invading species have the potential to transform this savanna by overtopping native trees, leading to ecosystem-level impacts.

Theory and empirical evidence suggest that community invasibility is influenced by propagule pressure, physical stress and biotic resistance from resident species. We studied patterns of exotic and native species richness across the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, and tested for exotic richness correlates with major environmental gradients, species pool size, and native richness, among and within different grassland habitat types. 2. Native and exotic richness were positively correlated across grassland types, increasing from lowland meadows and halophyte steppes, through humid to mesophyte prairies in more elevated topographic positions. Species pool size was positively correlated with local richness of native and exotic plants, being larger for mesophyte and humid prairies. Localities in the more stressful meadow and halophyte steppe habitats contained smaller fractions of their landscape species pools. 3. Native and exotic species numbers decreased along a gradient of increasing soil salinity and decreasing soil depth, and displayed a unimodal relationship with soil organic carbon. When covarying habitat factors were held constant, exotic and native richness residuals were still positively correlated across sites. Within grassland habitat types, exotic and native species richness were positively associated in meadows and halophyte steppes but showed no consistent relationship in the least stressful, prairie habitat types. 4. Functional group composition differed widely between native and exotic species pools. Patterns suggesting biotic resistance to invasion emerged only within humid prairies, where exotic richness decreased with increasing richness of native warm-season grasses. This negative relationship was observed for other descriptors of invasion such as richness and cover of annual cool-season forbs, the commonest group of exotics. 5. Our results support the view that ecological factors correlated with differences in invasion success change with the range of environmental heterogeneity encompassed by the analysis. Within narrow habitat ranges, invasion resistance may be associated with either physical stress or resident native diversity. Biotic resistance through native richness, however, appeared to be effective only at intermediate locations along a stress/fertility gradient. 6. We show that certain functional groups, not just total native richness, may be critical to community resistance to invasion.

We tested experimentally whether seed and seedling emergence characteristics and early growth of seedlings are associated with naturalization of South African Iridaceae. In a common garden experiment, we compared these characteristics between 30 species that have become naturalized elsewhere and 30 congeneric species that have been introduced elsewhere but have failed to become naturalized. 3. The average seed mass did not differ between naturalized and non-naturalized species but seedlings of naturalized species emerged faster and more profusely than their non-naturalized congeners.

Variation in resource requirements among plant species may cause changes in community composition when resource supply rates vary. Because exotic plants may differ in their requirements compared with native plants, changes in resource levels or ratios may change their invasive potential. The concentration hypothesis, nutrient balance hypothesis and resource ratio hypothesis make different predictions regarding the effects of nutrient additions on plant communities and the success of invaders. 2. We investigated these hypotheses using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an aggressive invader of grasslands in the southern USA. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were manipulated in a full factorial field experiment in a Texas coastal prairie. 3. Survival of Sapium seedlings over three growing seasons was independent of all three types of nutrient additions, alone or in any combination. Adding nitrogen or potassium increased the mass and height of Sapium seedlings. Adding phosphorus increased the mass and height of Sapium seedlings only when nitrogen was also added. These results support the nutrient balance hypothesis, which assumes that higher tissue concentrations of a nutrient reflect a greater ability of a plant species to take up and/or conserve that nutrient. 4. The above-ground biomass of background prairie vegetation was independent of the addition of each type of nutrient alone or in any combination. However, the functional composition of the community shifted from graminoids to forbs with the addition of nitrogen and from graminoids to woody plants with the addition of phosphorus. These results support the concentration hypothesis, which assumes that higher tissue concentrations of a nutrient reflect a greater requirement for that nutrient. The contrasting responses of native woody vegetation and Sapium to phosphorus addition suggest that Sapium may have unusually low demands for phosphorus relative to nitrogen for a woody plant in this community. 5. These results show that potassium or nitrogen addition, perhaps in combination with phosphorus addition, has the potential to accelerate the invasion of Sapium into Texas coastal prairies. Because anthropogenic nutrient additions are common in grasslands worldwide, this may help to explain the frequent success of woody species invading grasslands.",Web of Science,Sapium sebiferum,USA,Texas,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances,primary

The Pgm-1a & Pgm-2a multilocus genotype, which occurs in the grass's native range in Eastern Europe, is prevalent in eastern Canada but occurs at low frequency in western Canada. In contrast, the Got-4c multilocus genotype, found in the native range in Central Europe, is widespread in populations from western Canada. Overall genetic diversity of B. tectorum is much higher in eastern Canada than in the eastern U.S., while the genetic diversity in populations in western North America is similar between Canada and the U.S. The distribution of genetic diversity across Canada strongly suggests multiple introduction events.

We compared stress tolerance (as change in biomass) of the invasive macroalgae Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides and Gracilaria vermiculophylla to the native macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus, Agardhiella subulata, Hypnea musciformis and Ulva curvata in Hog Island Bay, a shallow lagoon in Virginia, USA. We hypothesized that the success of the two aliens is due to their high tolerances of turbidity, sedimentation, desiccation, grazing and nutrient enrichment. Like many lagoons, Hog Island Bay is characterized by extensive intertidal mudflats, high turbidity and sedimentation, and high densities of omnivorous mud snails. Nutrient enrichment may also become a problem as land use practices in adjacent watersheds change. Contrary to our hypothesis, C. fragile was less resistant to sedimentation, desiccation and grazing than other algae and had low growth at all light and nutrient levels. This suggests that any superior performance of this invasive species compared to native algae is probably limited to microhabitats where stress is minimal and where bivalve shells facilitate recruitment and long-term persistence. In contrast, G. vermiculophylla was resistant to desiccation, burial and grazing, and was not negatively influenced by either high or low light or nutrient levels. These traits reflect the current success of G. vermiculophylla in already invaded lagoons and estuaries, and indicates that it will likely continue its spread in European and North American turbid and tidal soft-sediment systems.",Web of Science,Codium fragile;Gracilaria vermiculophylla,USA,Virginia,Hog Island Bay,,,Field - Observational,estuarine,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Broad Tolerances,primary

It was recently suggested that post-introduction intraspecific hybridization between previously isolated genotypes could produce novel and/or heterotic progeny that might express enhanced invasiveness. We tested this hypothesis with Silene latifolia, a European native that has successfully invaded North America and has previously been shown to have undergone genetic change since its introduction. In a common garden experiment we compared the performance of plants derived from within and between population crosses from eight European and 18 North American populations. Results showed that there was no significant effect of crossing distance on progeny phenotype. Furthermore, progeny from within or between population crosses did not differ in size, reproductive output or survival.

A comprehensive survey of watermilfoil populations was conducted in five Minnesota lakes, three of which were suspected a priori to contain hybrid watermilfoil. DNA sequence data verified that hybrid plants between the nonindigenous M. spicatum L. and indigenous M. sibiricum Kom. occurred in three of the five lakes sampled. Myriophyllum spicatum was not detected in lakes where hybrids were prevalent. Further sampling of lakes in Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington identified 30 additional hybrid watermilfoil populations. In only three of these populations the hybrid watermilfoil was found to co-occur with M. spicatum. To facilitate the field identification of the two parental species and their hybrid, morphological data from watermilfoil specimens collected across the United States were evaluated. We determined that leaf segment/leaf length measurements can effectively distinguish M. spicatum and M. sibiricum; however, hybrids are intermediate for these characters and such measurements frequently overlap with respect to their parental taxa. By incorporating a combined molecular and morphological approach to identifying watermilfoils, the hybrids can be identified readily and their distributions elucidated both within and between lakes.

The bivalve Dreissena polymorpha has invaded many freshwater ecosystems worldwide in recent decades. Because of their high fecundity and ability to settle on almost any solid substratum, zebra mussels usually outcompete the resident species and cause severe damage to waterworks. Time series of D. polymorpha densities display a variety of dynamical patterns, including very irregular behaviours. Unfortunately, there is a lack of mathematical modelling that could explain these patterns. 2. Here, we propose a very simple discrete-time population model with age structure and density dependence that can generate realistic dynamics. Most of the model parameters can be derived from existing data on D. polymorpha. Some of them are quite variable: with respect to these we perform a sensitivity analysis of the model behaviour and verify that non-equilibrial regimes (either periodic or chaotic) are the rule rather than the exception. 3. Even in circumstances where the model dynamics are aperiodic it is possible to predict total density peaks from previous peaks. This turns out to be true also in the presence of environmental stochasticity. 4. Using the stochastic model we explore the effects of age-selective predation. Quite surprisingly, larger removal rates of adults do not always result in smaller population densities and mussel biomasses. Moreover, non-selective predation can result in skewed size-frequency distributions which, therefore, are not necessarily the footprint of predators' preference for larger or smaller zebra mussels.",Web of Science,Dreissena polymorpha,Many,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,lentic,,Fundamentals,,,filter

Low construction cost was hypothesized to give invaders a growth advantage by utilizing energy efficiently.

Hitchc, Lantana camara L., Urena lobata L. and Derris trifoliata Lour.), and provides insight into the success of this invasive weed. Mikania micrantha had the lowest leaf construction cost both on a mass basis (leaf CC(mass), 1.32 g glucose g(-1)) and on an area basis (leaf CC(area) 28.80 g glucose m(-2)). Mikania micrantha dominated the studied community with 60% coverage. The low leaf CC associated with its great abundance indicated that low energetic cost might benefit its spread. Additionally, a higher specific leaf area (SLA) and lower C and N concentrations were found in M micrantha, providing it with another competitive advantage. All the six studied species could be grouped into either an invasive or a native species category. Both the mean leaf CC(area),. and CC(mass) for the invasive were lower than those for the native species though the mean leaf CC(mass) was not significantly different. The result indicated that a low energetic cost of leaf construction might generally influence invasive potential.

The seeds were voided and the arils digested. Three thousand Barn Swallows in the region where this was observed conceivably consumed and voided two million Rooikrans seeds during the 5-month non-breeding period. Barn Swallows are therefore dispersers of Rooikrans seeds. Many of the bird species known to consume Rooikrans seeds are territorial, so that seeds are not dispersed far beyond existing acacia stands.

In the *repeated removal* treatment, all understory vegetation was initially removed by clipping and new exotic seedlings were repeatedly removed every 2 weeks throughout the study period. The *initial removal* treatment involved a one-time understory vegetation removal with no further weeding. Control plots had no intervention throughout the study period. We conducted vegetation surveys of the plots prior to treatment initiation and in April and August of 2002 and 2003. With a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination, we were able to discern differences in species composition between the repeated removal treatment and the other two treatments. However, using repeated measures ANOVA, we found no significant differences in native species richness, cover, and abundance among treatments during most sampling periods. We also used a seedbank study to determine that while some early successional species, were present, no native shrubs and few native trees emerged from the seedbank. These results suggest that (1) repeated removal is required to decrease the importance of exotic species, especially if the site is in close proximity to a source of exotic propagules; and (2) subsequent to exotic removal, native species may not recover sufficiently without supplemental plantings.

All specimens were genetically differentiated using molecular tools to identify the genotype (native or exotic). The exotic genotype (haplotype M) has been present in Quebec as early as 1916, but it was rare prior to the 1970s and was almost exclusively restricted to the shores of the St. Lawrence River.

This study provides evidence that, in Quebec, the development of the highway network in the 1960s and 1970s strongly contributed to the inland expansion of the exotic genotype.

We explored the connections between site variables and spread rate using quantile regression, Tobit regression, a parametric model for heterogeneous error variance, and classification and regression tree modeling.

Yet, one of the key aspects, the initial phase of invasion, is rarely observed in detail. Data from aerial photographs covering the spread of Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae, native to Caucasus) on a local scale of hectares in the Czech Republic from the beginning of invasion were used as an input for an individual-based model (IBM), based on small-scale and short-time data. To capture the population development inferred from the photographs, long-distance seed dispersal, changes in landscape structures and suitability of landscape elements to invasion by H. mantegazzianum were implemented in the model. The model was used to address (1) the role of long-distance dispersal in regional invasion dynamics, and (2) the effect of land-use changes on the progress of the invasion. Simulations showed that already small fractions of seed subjected to long-distance dispersal, as determined by systematic comparison of field data and modelling results, had an over-proportional effect on the spread of this species. The effect of land-use changes on the simulated course of invasion depends on the actual level of habitat saturation; it is larger for populations covering a high proportion of available habitat area than for those in the initial phase of invasion. Our results indicate how empirical field data and model outputs can be linked more closely with each other to improve the understanding of invasion dynamics.

The biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis postulates that species-rich communities are less vulnerable to invasion because vacant niches are less common and the intensity of interspecific competition is more severe. Field studies were conducted at two sites, a logged site and an unlogged site in Santa Rosa County, Florida, U.S.A, to test Elton's hypothesis using cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), a non-indigenous grass invading large areas of the Southeastern United States. The logged site was under 17-year-old loblolly pine prior to clear cutting. The unlogged site, a longleaf pine forest, was at the Blackwater River State Forest. Both the logged site and unlogged site showed no significant relationship between the rate of cogongrass spread and native plant species richness, functional richness, and cover of the invaded community. Increased species or functional richness may increase the use of resources; however, the extensive rhizome/root network possessed by cogongrass and its ability to thrive under shade may allow for its persistence in a diverse community. The results from both the logged and unlogged sites do not support the general hypothesis of Elton that invasion resistance and compositional stability increase with diversity. Biodiversity does not appear to be an important factor for cogongrass invasion in the southern United States. Extrinsic factors in this study prevent the ability to draw a defined causal relationship between native plant diversity and invasibility. Underlying reasons for why no relationship was observed may be simply due to the tremendous competitive ability of cogongrass or the narrow range of species richness, functional richness and cover observed in our study.",Web of Science,Imperata cylindrica,USA,Florida,Blackwater River State Forest,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Coniferous Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

Alien plant species are well known to disrupt ecological services of native ecosystems, change the composition of native habitats, and often lead to the extirpation of native flora and fauna. Here, we report on life history patterns of plant species with rapidly spreading and declining ranges in North America's major urban region. We tested for differences in life history traits between the 466 native and alien woody flora of the New York metropolitan area. We also examined the relationship between life history traits and change in distribution in the New York metropolitan area between 1900 and 2000. Native and alien species of the New York metropolitan area differ with respect to pollination vector and breeding system. However, pollination vector and breeding system are not associated with success, defined here as increasing range spread in the urban environment; instead, fruit type (dispersal), life form and origin are important determinants of success. Alien species that are deciduous trees, shrubs or vines with fleshy fruit are the most successful in increasing their distribution in this urban landscape. Newly introduced species with these characteristics are expected to have a better chance at establishing in similar urban landscapes and should be targets for intensive management.

There are both tall and dwarf forms of the species in China. The tall form with strongly invasive ability has widely expanded. Genetic variation was examined within and among three tall form S. alterniflora populations in Jiangsu Province using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers. Three populations were sampled along the coastal line, and each population was divided into three subpopulations relating with the three microenvironments: Foreland, mid-marsh and upland. Genetic diversity was low at both the population level (PPB = 22%, H (E) = 0. 0657 and H (pop) = 0.099) and at the species level (PPB = 24.65%, H (T) = 0.0814 and H (sp) = 0.1225). A low level of genetic differentiation among populations was detected based on analyses of coefficients of genetic differentiation (9.51%), Shannon's diversity index (9.48%) and AMOVA (10.69%). The mean value of Gst among nine subpopulations was 22.02%. Habitat selections may occur and affect the genetic structure of S. alterniflora in the process of its spread because there are 7.2, 3.4 and 5.9% specific bands out of 158 polymorphic bands in foreland, mid-marsh, and upland, respectively. This genetic differentiation may result from seedling survival and colonization success based on the selection of specialized microhabitats.

Using fyke nets, we sampled round gobies in lake and adjacent wetland habitats in four systems in 2004 and six systems in 2005. In each macrohabitat (lake or wetland), we sampled three miccrohabitats (mono-dominant stands of Nuphar, beds of submersed aquatic vegetation, and bare sediment).

We also found a significant negative correlation between round goby catch and distance of sampling points from the Lake Michigan shoreline in 2005, suggesting that 1) Lake Michigan nearshore waters (including the connecting navigation channels and pier areas) may be serving as round gob.), spawning and nursery habitats with subsequent dispersal into the tributary lake/lwetland complexes, and 2) round gobies may still be invading these systems from Lake Michigan.

Overall, ruffe used open habitats more often than did round gobies, primarily when food was scattered. Round gobies used rocks significantly more frequently than did ruffe, but their use of rock habitat decreased during dark conditions.

However, anthropogenic stressors, such as invasive species, land-use change, and water-level stabilization, interact to shift the historical cycle (of native vegetation migration up- and down-slope) toward dominance by invasive Typha species. Knowing from earlier studies that water-level stabilization alters the historical vegetation cycle, we asked if similar shifts can occur where water levels are not stabilized. Using historical aerial photographs of three coastal wetlands (in Lake Michigan's Green Bay, Wisconsin), we determined that habitat dominated by Typha species has expanded to eliminate wet meadow habitat. Between 1974 and 1992, linear regressions showed strong, significant relationships of both meadow area (R(2) >= 0.894; p < 0.02) and marsh area (R(2) >= 0.784; p < 0.05) to water level in all three wetlands. In 2000, meadow area was below that predicted by the historical pattern due to the landward advance of marsh habitat during a year of decreasing water levels. In the same period, land use in the wetland watersheds converted from agriculture to urban. Urbanization and the replacement of native Typha lat folia by the invasive hybrid Typha xglauca may have overwhelmed the beneficial impact of water-level fluctuation.

Higher soil surface temperatures were recorded in the lowlands and in rain-shadow areas, which were also the driest areas. L. peduncularis, with a shallow root system, behaved as a drought-tolerant species, showing lower relative growth rates, which decreased with leaf water content and higher photosynthetic stress levels in the lowlands and in a northwest rain-shadow area in comparison with higher and wetter locations. Its basal and maximal fluorescences decreased at lower altitudes, reflecting the recorded drops in chlorophyll concentration. In contrast, L. camara with a deep root system behaved as a drought-avoiding species, showing leaf and relative water contents higher than 55% and avoiding permanent damage to its photosynthetic apparatus even in the driest area where it showed very low chlorophyll content. Its relative growth rate decreased more in dry areas in comparison to wetter zones than did that of L. peduncularis, even though it had greater water content. Furthermore, L. camara showed higher water contents, growth rate, and lower photosynthetic stress levels than L. peduncularis in the arid lowlands. Thus, L. peduncularis maintained lower maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (F (v)/F (m)) than L. camara even at sunrise, due to higher basal fluorescence values with similar maximal fluorescence, which indicated permanent damage to PSII reaction centres.

At each site, I collected between 22 and 119 frogs from 20 x 20-m plots, and invertebrates from light traps, beating trays, and leaf litter samples. Prey items in frog stomachs were identified to order, and invertebrates collected in environmental samples were identified to the lowest taxonomic category possible.

Sand coarseness significantly increased with exposure while soil nitrate levels significantly decreased. The more extreme end of the gradient was also subject to greater wind speeds and less soil moisture. 4 The plant community consistently responded to this gradient in the 7 years censused. Species richness decreased with exposure, cover of natives decreased and cover of exotics increased at the more extreme end of the gradient. 5 A single-season wind-shelter experiment similarly shifted the balance between native and exotic species. Shelters decreased the relative density of exotic species and increased the relative density of natives regardless of position on the gradient. 6 These comparative and manipulative findings both suggest that a single factor, wind, at least partially explains the success of exotic species in a coastal dune plant community.

In well-established subtidal assemblages, numbers of NIS were 1.5-2.5 times greater on pontoons or pilings than on rocky reefs, despite the local species pool of natives being up to 2.5 times greater than that of NIS. Conversely, on reefs and seawalls, numbers of native species were up to three times greater than numbers of NIS. Differential recruitment to different positions and types of surfaces appeared to influence distribution patterns. NIS recruited well to most surfaces, particularly concrete surfaces near the surface of the water, whilst natives occurred infrequently on wooden surfaces. The position of rocky reefs and seawalls close to the shore and to the seabed appeared to make them favourable for the recruitment of natives, but this positioning alone does not hinder the recruitment of NIS. We argue that pontoons and pilings represent beachheads (i.e. entry points for invasion) for many nonindigenous epibiota and so enhance the spread and establishment of NIS in estuaries.

Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic deviations, delta C-13 and delta N-15, of common Atlantic slippersnails and Pacific oysters were analysed relative to isotopic composition and availability of end-members. Slippersnail deviations were less variable over the sampling period compared with those of oysters. Significant differences between delta C-13 and delta N-15 of C. fornicata and C. gigas were found from winter to early summer, and linked to major isotopic changes in oysters. We identified three distinct seasonal periods: January to March when oysters were N-15-enriched compared to slippersnails and to themselves at other times of the year, April to June-July when oysters showed a N-15-depletion and a more marked C-13-depletion compared to slippersnails and to themselves at other times of the year, and July-August to December when both species presented similar carbon and nitrogen deviations. Species-specific differences in qualitative selection capability may explain these seasonal differences in isotopic deviations. Whereas the isotopic composition of the indiscriminate suspension-feeding slippersnails reflects the composition of the seston throughout the year, the oyster is capable of qualitative selection. The oyster isotopic compositions are consistent with a facultative activation of selection mechanisms under conditions of qualitative and quantitative food limitation, notably the preferential ingestion and assimilation of the dominant organic source in the suspended pool. We conclude that C. fornicata and C gigas are trophic competitors only in winter and spring at this site, where detrital end-members are major POM components. These results underscore (1) the importance of long-term (annual) studies in the evaluation of potential trophic competition, and (2) the necessity to include the qualitative selection capacities of suspension-feeders in future interpretations of trophic relationships in marine coastal ecosystems.

Oxalis pes-caprae is an invasive winter geophyte in the Mediterranean Islands that reproduces vegetatively via bulbs. An investigation was made into the relative responses of O. pes-caprae and the native annual grass Lolium rigidum to nutrient availability and to competition with each other in order to understand patterns of invasion in the field. Because Oxalis accumulates oxalic acid in its leaves, which could ameliorate soil phosphorous availability, field observations were made to determine whether the presence of Oxalis alters soil P availability. Methods A full-factorial glasshouse experiment was conducted with nutrient availability (high and low) and competition (Lolium alone, Oxalis alone, and Lolium and Oxalis together). Plant performance was assessed by determining (1) above- and below-ground biomass at the time of Oxalis maximum biomass and (2) reproductive output of Oxalis and Lolium at the end of their respective growth cycles. Measurements were also taken for leaf N and P content. Soil samples were taken in the field from paired Oxalis-invaded and non-invaded plots located in Menorca (Balearic Islands) and available P was determined. Key Results High nutrient availability increased Oxalis and Lolium vegetative biomass and reproductive output to a similar degree. Competition with Lolium had a much stronger negative effect on Oxalis bulb production than reduced nutrients. Lolium was a superior competitor than Oxalis; the latter did not affect Lolium maximum biomass and spike production. Significantly greater soil-P availability in Oxalis-invaded field soils relative to paired non-invaded soils suggest that Oxalis influences soil P cycling. Conclusions Oxalis is a poor competitor. This is consistent with the preferential distribution of Oxalis in disturbed areas such as ruderal habitats, and might explain its low influence on the cover of native species in invaded sites. The results also suggest that certain disturbances (e.g. autumn ploughing) may greatly enhance Oxalis invasion.",Web of Science,Oxalis pes-caprae,Spain,Menorca,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,

In a field experiment, we varied densities of the non-native annual grass Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens around individuals of three native Mojave Desert perennials-Larrea tridentata, Achnatherum hymenoides, and Pleuraphis rigida-in either winter or spring. For comparison, additional plots were prepared for the same perennial species and seasons, but with a mixture of native annual species as neighbors. Growth of perennials declined when Bromus was established in winter because Bromus stands had 2-3 months of growth and high water use before perennial growth began. However, water potentials for the perennials were not significantly reduced, suggesting that direct competition for water may not be the major mechanism driving reduced perennial growth. The impact of Bromus on Larrea was lower than for the two perennial grasses, likely because Larrea maintains low growth rates throughout the year, even after Bromus has completed its life cycle. This result contrasts with the perennial grasses, whose phenology completely overlaps with (Achnatherum) or closely follows (Pleuraphis) that of Bromus. In comparison, Bromus plants established in spring were smaller than those established in winter and thus did not effectively reduce growth of the perennials. Growth of perennials with mixed annuals as neighbors also did not differ from those with Bromus neighbors of equivalent biomass, but stands of these native annuals did not achieve the high biomass of Bromus stands that were necessary to reduce perennial growth. Seed dormancy and narrow requirements for seedling survivorship of native annuals produce densities and biomass lower than those achieved by Bromus; thus, impacts of native Mojave Desert annuals on perennials are expected to be lower than those of Bromus.",Web of Science,Bromus madritensis,USA,California,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Fluctuating Resources,,primary

High plant densities occur only when founding plants are able to disperse their seeds well locally to quickly colonize and fill the new patch. We test this ability in a 7-year field experiment with Carduus acanthoides, an invasive weed in several North American ecosystems. Founder plants were planted in the center of 64 m(2) plots and we monitored the recruitment, distribution pattern, mortality, and seed production of the seedlings that originated from these founding plants. Competing vegetation was clipped not at all, once, or twice each year to evaluate the importance of interspecific competition. More seedlings recruited in the intermediate once-clipped plots, and these seedlings also survived better. The control plots had fewer microsites for seedling recruitment; clipping a second time in September stimulated grasses to fill up the gaps. The number of C. acanthoides recruits and their median distances from the founder plants were also explained by the initial seed production of the founding plants. Overall, the experiment shows that the success of founder plants can fluctuate strongly, as 55% of the plots were empty by the sixth year.

To investigate the invasive potential of Lolium multiflorum (Per.) into alkali sites in California, an ex-situ reciprocal transfer experiment was carried out using seeds from populations of L. multiflorum taken from three sites differing in alkalinity (and inundation), including alkali sink soils (pH 8.5) and sink matrix soils (pH 7.4) located within meters of each other, and non-sink soils (pH 5.0) located several km away. Survivorship, plant height, leaf number and seed production were assessed. In addition, a native composite, Hemizonia pungens (Hick.), commonly found on alkali sinks was also sampled at the sink and sink matrix microsites. Lolium multiflorum plants grown from alkali sink and sink matrix seeds produced fewer leaves and seeds but were taller than plants grown from non-alkali seeds, the latter perhaps an adaptation to frequently inundated soils. Non-alkali genotypes fared poorly in sink soils for all traits, both in comparison to their growth on non-sink soils, and in comparison to the sink and sink edge genotypes. This suggests the existence of L. multiflorum ecotypes adapted to inundated alkali sinks, a genotypic difference that occurs on a broad spatial scale (kilometers), but not so obviously on the micro-site scale (meters) between sink and sink matrix populations. These data suggest that the absence of exotic invasives from alkali sites may be temporary if they are evolving tolerance for these severe sites, and this may threaten the future of the native alkali specialists that currently find refuge in these sites.",Web of Science,Lolium multiflorum,USA,California,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

Five fertilization rates were tested for monocultures and two for mixtures where six combinations of planting densities were used in two seasons (spring and fall). Monitoring of plant biomass was made at the end of each of these 2-month-experiments. In contrast to E densa, clear seasonal patterns in biomass production and in reproductive allocations of H. verticillata were evident. Competitive pressure for both species was lower during the fall experiment. Biomass production increased with fertilization for H. verticillata in monocultures and changes either in allocative ratios or in tuber production patterns were shown in response to nutrient availability. However, E. densa growth was not affected by fertilization. In most cases, H. verticillata was a better competitor than E. densa except when sediment was pure sand. Competition occurred mainly for nutrient uptake rather than for light harvesting. These results suggest that despite the similar ecology, H. verticillata may outcompete E. densa in many situations, probably due to its higher plasticity.

Trin. ex Steud. is virtually cosmopolitan and shows substantial variation in euploidy level and morphology. The aim of this study was to assess clone-specific differences in morphological, anatomical, physiological and biochemical traits of P. australis as affected by the geographic origin, the euploidy level (4x, 6x, 8x and 12x), and to assess differences between native and introduced clones in North America. Growth, morphology, photosynthetic characteristics, photosynthetic pigments and enzymes were measured on 11 geographically distinct clones propagated in a common environment in Denmark. Any differences between the measured parameters were caused by genetic differences between clones. Overall, the largest differences between clones were found in ontogeny, shoot morphology and leaf anatomy. The North Swedish clone was adapted to short growing seasons and sprouted very early in the spring but senesced early in July. In contrast, clones from southern regions were adapted to warmer and longer growing seasons and failed to complete the whole growth-cycle in Denmark. Some clones from oceanic habitats with climatic conditions that do not differ much from conditions at the Danish growth site did flower in the common environment. The octoploid genotype in general had larger dimensions of leaves, taller and thicker shoots and larger cell sizes than did the hexaploid and tetraploid clones. The dodecaploid clone was neither bigger than the octoploid, nor significantly different from tetraploid and hexaploid clones in most of the morphological characters observed. Stomatal density decreased with increasing ploidy level, while length of guard cells increased. Tetraploid clones generally had morphometric dimensions, similar to hexaploids. Hence, polyploidy did not always result in an increase in plant size, probably because the number of cell divisions during development is reduced. Four North American clones were included in the study. The clone from the Atlantic Coast and the supposed invasive European clone resembled each other. The Gulf Coast clone differed from the rest of the clones in having leaf characters resembling Phragmites mauritianus Kunth. Thus, morphological characters are not unmistakable parameters that can be used to discriminate between introduced and native clones. The physiological and biochemical processes also differed between clones, but these processes showed considerable phenotypic plasticity and were therefore very difficult to evaluate conclusively. It is concluded that P. australis is a species with very high genetic variability which is augmented by its cosmopolitan distribution, clonal growth form and the large variation in chromosome numbers. It is therefore not surprising that large genetically determined differences in ontogeny, shoot morphology and leaf anatomy occur between clones. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our results indicate that the modern distribution of normative plants is influenced by multiple, interdependent current and historical factors. Glaciolacustrine landforms had greater nonnative species richness and cover than beach-dune, moraine, and glacial outwash sand plain landforms. Extant open-canopied areas (i.e., grasslands, dunes, heather barrens, and old fields) harbored significantly greater normative species richness and cover than closed-canopy forests, heathlands, and shrublands. Additionally, soil calcium levels and native species richness were positively associated with normative species richness. Sites that were cultivated historically or experienced other soil disturbance had higher normative species richness than areas without soil disturbance. Overall, abiotic, biotic and historical land use affected levels of normative species richness whereas normative cover was largely associated with abiotic conditions, particularly soil characteristics.

For each woody plant, we also measured height, soil depth, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); the latter two measurements were taken at the four cardinal directions.

The year of the introduction of B. violaceus remains a matter of dispute because many of the Botrylloides specimens that are recorded in western Europe, have been identified as the closely resembling species B. leachi. Only Didemnum sp. has become a true invasive species and has become a threat to native ecosystems, especially in the province of Zeeland, by its ability to overgrow virtually all hard substrata present. This includes rocks, stones, sand, algae and almost all sessile marine animals. The sudden population expansion of the didemnid from 1996 onward, coincided with the cold winter of 19951996, which caused decreased population sizes of many marine animals. The resulting increase in the availability of suitable substrates for settlement and the strong decrease of grazing sea urchins, may have triggered the population expansion. Studying its population dynamics, the optimal growing temperature for Didemnum sp. appears to be 14-18 degrees C. Virtually all colonies die when the water temperature gets colder than 5 degrees C. Colonies growing on live marine animals seem to be more resistant to the cold, than those growing on rocks, stones and plants.

The link between disturbance and invasion potential has rarely been studied in the marine environment where dominance hierarchies, dynamics of larval supply, and resource acquisition may differ greatly from terrestrial systems. In this study, hard substrate marine communities in Long Island Sound, USA were used to assess the effect of disturbance on resident species and recent invaders, ascidian growth form (i.e. colonial and solitary growth form), and the dominant species-specific responses within the community. Community age was an additional factor considered through manipulation of 5-wk old assemblages and 1-yr old assemblages. Disturbance treatments, exposing primary substrate, were characterized by frequency (single, biweekly, monthly) and magnitude (20%, 48%, 80%) of disturbance. In communities of different ages, disturbance frequency had a significant positive effect on space occupation of recent invaders and a significant negative effect on resident species. In the 5-wk community, magnitude of disturbance also had a significant effect. Disturbance also had a significant effect on ascidian growth form; colonial species occupied more primary space than controls in response to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude. In contrast, solitary species occupied significantly less space than controls. Species-specific responses were similar regardless of community age. The non-native colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum responded positively to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude, and occupied more primary space in treatments than in controls. The resident solitary ascidian Molgula manhattensis responded negatively to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude, and occupied less primary space in treatments than in controls. Small-scale biological disturbances, by creating space, may facilitate the success of invasive species and colonial organisms in the development of subtidal hard substrate communities.

Field experiments were conducted over a four month period at two locations (Lynn and Woods Hole, MA) to examine growth dynamics over regional thermal and geographic ranges. Invasive ascidians occupied as much as 80% of the primary substratum and accounted for the majority of species richness. B. violaceus and D. listerianum growth were similar at both study sites, but initial colony growth of D. listerianum was positively affected by temperature. B. violaceus and D. listerianum exhibited rapid two-week growth rates during the summer months with more rapid growth at the warmer Woods Hole site. Competition for space between B. violaceus and D. listerianum typically resulted in neutral borders between colonies.

Recruitment and growth of native species influenced the long-term composition of experimental communities more than the pre-seeding with B. violaceus or D. listerianum colonies. Elevated temperatures, however, increased initial growth of B. violaceus and D. listerianum and may have facilitated the species success to invade the communities during crucial periods of introduction.

A colonial ascidian, Didemnum sp. has invaded southern New England during the past 10 years and we first observed this species in eastern Long Island Sound in 2000. It has become the dominant at several field sites while remaining in low abundance at others. We conducted an experiment at two places, a protected marina and an open coast site, to examine its ability to compete with the established fouling community. Small colonies of Didemnum were transplanted onto panels with communities that varied in age from one to four weeks old and these treatments along with controls with only Didemnum were exposed at both sites. In most treatments Didemnum became a dominant species in the communities at both sites but it reached higher abundances at the open coast site. Potential causes of the observed differences are predation on other species of ascidians at the open coast site reducing recruitment of these species and competition, lower tolerance for elevated temperatures at the marina site, or other environmental parameters that might affect growth rates.

This study focuses on the invasion of the Gulf of Maine by the colonial ascidians Botryllus schlosseri, Botrylloides violaceus, Diplosoma listerianum and Didemnum sp. A. We examined the time of arrival and potential vectors for these four invasive ascidians using survey data (collected from 1969 onwards) and literature documentation. We also compared the dominance and seasonal patterns of abundance of these species using data from two identical panel studies; one conducted from 1979 to 1980, the other from 2003 to 2005. Didemnum and Botrylloides were most likely first introduced into the Damariscotta River, Maine in the early 1970's through oyster aquaculture while Botryllus and Diplosoma were probably transported by commercial and recreational vessels. The overall abundance of colonial ascidians has increased since 1979 and 1980. Botryllus was the only invasive colonial ascidian present during the 1979 to 1980 study and accounted for an average of 6.16% cover on panels. From 2003 to 2005, the more recently arrived colonial ascidians Botrylloides and Didemnum accounted for 7.38% and 2.08% cover respectively, while Botryllus covered only 1.16%. Our results reveal a shift in seasonal abundance between 1979 to 1980 and 2003 to 2004. In 1979 and 1980, colonial ascidians had the highest percent cover in fall and winter while in 2003 and 2005 they bad highest percent cover in summer and fall. Seasonal patterns of space occupation by colonial ascidians were correlated with seasonal changes in seawater temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Suspension-feeding invertebrate communities often dominate vertical and undercut rock surfaces, while macroalgae dominate horizontal surfaces. One factor that may shape this pattern is sea urchin grazing, which is often more intense on horizontal surfaces. The native Gulf of Maine ascidian Aplidium glabrum, like other native ascidians, is generally restricted to vertical and undercut rock walls, whereas the introduced ascidian Botrylloides violaceous is often abundant on horizontal surfaces. We tested the hypothesis that this pattern could be due to differing predation intensity on these two ascidians by Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, a dominant omnivore in the Gulf of Maine. Feeding preference of S. droebachiensis on the native A. glabrum vs. B. violaceous was estimated in the laboratory and in field experiments. Laboratory results show that S. droebachiensis prefers to feed on the native ascidian A. glabrum over B. violaceous. In the field, potential differences in the impact of S. droebachiensis on the two species were masked by the much greater growth rate of B. violaceus compared to A. glabrum. These results may help explain observed patterns in ascidian distribution in the Gulf of Maine, and ultimately the overall success of B. violaceus as a major invader throughout New England.

In its native habitat (southern Africa) this species has been reported as heterostylous with trimorphic flowers and a self- and morph-incompatible reproductive system. In most of the areas invaded, only a pentaploid short-styled morphotype that reproduces mainly asexually by bulbils is reported, but this has only been confirmed empirically. This study aims to analyse the floral morph proportions in a wide distribution area, test the sexual female success, and explain the causes of low sexual reproduction of this species in the western area of the Mediterranean Basin. Methods Fifty-five populations of O. pes-caprae were sampled in the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco to evaluate the floral morph ratio and individual fruit set. In plants from a dimorphic population, hand-pollination experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of the pollen source on pollen tube growth through the style. The ploidy level and genome size of individuals of each floral morph were analysed using flow cytometry. Key Results From the populations studied 89.1% were monomorphic, with most of them containing the short-styled (SS) floral morph, and 10.9% were dimorphic containing long-styled (LS) and SS morphs. In some of these, isoplethy was verified but no fruit production was observed in any population. A sterile form was also recorded in several populations. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that pollen grains germinated over recipient stigmas. In intermorph crossings, pollen tubes were able to develop and fruit initiation was observed in some cases, while in intramorph pollinations, pollen tube development was sporadic and no fruit initiation was observed. All individuals within each floral form presented the same DNA ploidy level: SS plants were pentaploid and LS and the sterile form were tetraploid. Conclusions The low or null sexual reproduction success of this species in the area of invasion studied seems related with the high frequency of monomorphic populations, the unequal proportion of floral morphs in dimorphic populations and the presence of different ploidy levels between SS and LS morphs. The discovery of the occurrence of an LS floral morph and a sterile form, whose invading capacity in these areas is as yet unknown, will be valuable information for management programmes.",Web of Science,Oxalis pes-caprae,Spain;Morocco,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Clonal Reproduction,primary

This disease causes lethal stem infections in oaks (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), as well as non-lethal foliar infections in a range of other species. We investigated two questions to evaluate the effect of landscape structure on the spread of P. ramorum: (i) does the spatial pattern of forested habitat predict P. ramorum disease severity, and is this relationship scale-dependent; and (ii) what influence does spatial pattern have on the optimal microclimate conditions for P. ramorum reproduction? We mapped the spatial distribution of suitable forest habitat for P. ramorum and established 86 randomly located field plots within a 20-km(2) region of northern California. For each plot, we quantified P. ramorum disease severity and measured the abundance of woody species. Disease severity in each plot was examined in relation to the surrounding landscape structure measured for nested landscapes of increasing scale. P. ramorum disease severity was greatest in plots surrounded by a high proportion of contiguous forest, after accounting for plot-level variables of host abundance, elevation, canopy cover and microclimate. The explanatory power of the model increased with increasing scale up to 200 m, but was not significant at scales less than 50 m. High disease severity was associated with lower temperatures in the field than the laboratory-determined optimal range for pathogen reproduction. Variation in microclimate conditions was explained by elevation, not the pattern of host vegetation, indicating that spatially varying disease severity was not a function of microclimate-related edge effects on pathogen growth and survival. Both landscape-scale configuration and local composition of host habitat are related to the severity of this destructive forest disease. Increased disease severity within contiguous woodlands may have a considerable impact on the composition of such woodlands, with cascading effects on the population dynamics of both host and pathogen.",Web of Science,Phytophthora ramorum,USA,California,,,,Field - Observational;Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Fundamentals,,,pathogen

However, the Australian Burkholderia strains represented several divergent lineages, none of which had a close relationship to currently known Burkholderia strains in American M. pigra populations. Inoculation of M. pigra with Australian strains resulted in equal or higher plant growth and nodule nitrogenase activity (measured by acetylene reduction assays) relative to outcomes with bacteria from M. pigra's native geographic region. The main difference in symbiotic phenotype for bacteria from the two regions involved responses to an alternate Mimosa host species: Central American strains failed to fix nitrogen in association with Mimosa pudica, while most Australian Burkholderia isolates tested had high nodule nitrogenase activity in association with both Mimosa species.

In the eastern U.S., invasive Ailanthus altissima and native Liriodendron tulipifera have similar life histories and niches and often co-occur. To examine how disturbance affects the establishment of these species, we performed field experiments to evaluate the response of sown seeds and transplanted seedlings to three levels of disturbance on north- and south-facing aspects. L. tulipifera germination was severely limited by low seed viability and had significantly lower germination than A. altissima in all sites. The effect of disturbance regime on A. altissima germination depended on aspect in the second growing season. In contrast, mean seedling survival, biomass, leaf area and leaf area ratio were greater for L. tulipifera in all field sites. Overall, the north-facing selective cut forest provided a disproportionately large number of suitable microsites for L. tulipifera establishment. Collectively, this study demonstrated that different timber harvest practices produce heterogeneous mosaics of suitable microsites for germination and establishment. Limited L. tulipifera germination may be a serious constraint to population establishment if seeds are deposited for the first time immediately after a disturbance event. However, if sufficient viable seeds of both species exist, L. tulipifera out-performs the invasive in the first two years following disturbance.

In a previous work, we found that invasive species in the family Commelinaceae were more opportunistic than their noninvasive congeners and could therefore outperform noninvasive relatives in an environment with abundant resources and no competition. Contrary to the expectation that superior performance under favorable conditions comes at the cost of reduced performance under stressful conditions, invasive species did not perform more poorly relative to noninvasive congeners under any conditions we examined. Here we expand our search for potential costs of opportunism in invasive species to additional environmental conditions in which invasive taxa have been shown or predicted to perform poorly. We grew four invasive and four noninvasive species in environments consisting of all possible combinations of high and low soil resources and presence and absence of clipping (removal of aboveground biomass). We also fed leaves of each species to a generalist herbivore to assess resistance to herbivory. We found that the advantage of invasive species is reduced but not eliminated by low soil resources and clipping. At low soil resources, invasive species produced softer leaves than noninvasive species and might therefore be less resistant to generalist herbivory than noninvasive species, although a direct comparison of resistance in a no-choice bioassay revealed no difference.

The recent discovery of this rust fungus on the telial host Pedicularis racemosa Dougl. ex Benth., raises questions of whether this host association represents a recent acquisition by C. ribicola or a long-standing host association that was overlooked.

Genetic analysis of C. ribicola isolates from different aecial and telial hosts provided no evidence for genetic differentiation and showed similar levels of expected heterozygosity within a geographic population. An inoculation test showed that diverse C. ribicola sources from across North America had the capacity to infect Pedicularis racemosa.

In 2005, we examined gut contents of 30 round gobies from each of three depths, 55, 95, and 130 m, and qualitatively compared gut contents with density of benthic invertebrates determined by Ponar grabs. Round goby guts contained mostly Dreissena spp. and opposum shrimp, Mysis relicta (Mysis); the frequency of occurrence of dreissenids in guts decreased with depth, whereas the frequency of occurrence of Mysis in guts increased with depth. Abundance of these invertebrates in the environment followed the same pattern, although dreissenids of optimum edible size (3-12 mm) were still abundant (1,373/m(2)) at 130 m, where round gobies primarily consumed Mysis, suggesting that round gobies may switch from dreissenids to more profitable prey when it is available. Other food items were ostracods and fish, with ostracods generally eaten by smaller round gobies and fish eaten by larger round gobies.

Here, we investigate the temporal stability of genetic diversity and structure in relation to sex and age in introduced populations of Crepidula fornicata, an exotic gastropod that successfully invaded Europe. This protandrous species has the potential to change sex from male to female according not only to age, but also to local sex ratio (social environment). This mechanism may adjust the reproduction efficiency across different cohorts and thus decrease the likelihood of genetic drift in the following generations. Based on crude demographic structure analysis in two spatially closed introduced French populations, we demonstrate that recruitment is discontinuous. Although timing of sex change is different across populations, both populations have a similar age structure characterized by distributions of males and females changing across generations. Using five microsatellite loci, we show that both populations display a temporal genetic homogeneity and a stability in genetic diversity indices across age groups examined. Our results highlight that the social control of sex change in C. fornicata has strong implications to the maintenance of high genetic diversity by enhancing breeding across several generations at each reproductive season.

Aggression was highest between colonies from spatially different populations on the island and was higher still when nests were assayed against colonies at an off-island site 70 km away in Castine, ME.

We examined the link between propagate pressure created by the presence of ornamental plants in the market and their ability to escape from cultivation and establish in the wild.

Species that had escaped from cultivation were more frequently on sale both in the nineteenth century and today than nonescaping species. We used logit regression models to identify biological and socioeconomic variables that affect species' abilities to escape cultivation and become established, Frequencies in the market in the nineteenth century and today were good explanatory variables that distinguished escaping from nonescaping species, whereas for the transition from casual to established status these two socioeconomic variables were either absent or only of weak significance. Biological characteristics that increased the probability that a species would escape from cultivation were species height, a European native range, and being an annual. Climbing plants and species intolerant of low temperatures were less likely to escape. In contrast, the establishment probability was greater if the species belonged to a genus native to Britain and increased as the number of continents in a plants native range increased.

However, it is not clear if this only applies to exotic species or also to native species arriving at a site with few other native species during community assembly. We tested the latter by transplanting four native species into experimental grassland communities varying in species richness form 1-16 (-60) species. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that invasion is less successful if the invading species belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community. The test invaders included a grass species (Festuca pratensis, FP), a short (Plantago lanceolata, PL) and a tall herb species (Knautia arvensis, KA), and a legume species (Trifolium pratense, TP). The same four functional groups also occurred alone or in all possible combinations in the different experimental communities. The overall performance of the transplants was negatively related to the logarithm of the species richness of host communities. Plant biomass declined by 58%, 90%, 84% and 62% in FP, PL, KA and TP, respectively, from monocultures to 16-species mixtures, indicating lower invasiveness of the two herbs than of the grass and the legume. Resident grasses showed a strong negative effect on the performance of all test invaders, whereas resident small and tall herbs had neutral, and resident legumes had positive effects. The case of the legumes indicates that contributions to invasion resistance need not parallel invasiveness. Communities containing resident species of only one functional group were most inhibitive to transplants of the same functional group. These results indicate that invasion resistance of experimental plant communities is related to the degree of niche overlap between resident species and invaders. This niche overlap can be high due to generally low amounts of empty niche space in species-rich resident communities or due to the occurrence of the same functional group as the one of the invader in the resident community. Stronger within-than between-functional-group invasion resistance may be the key mechanism underlying diversity effects on invasion resistance in grassland and other ecosystems at large.",Web of Science,Festuca pratensis;Plantago lanceolata;Knautia arvensis;Trifolium pratense,Germany,,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

Rosa rugosa is an abundant non-native shrub in coastal habitats of NW Europe; it is common along the Baltic coast but more scarce in exposed dunes of the North Sea. To investigate whether invasion of exposed dunes is limited by seed, habitat and microhabitat limitation, seedling emergence and establishment were examined in a factorial sowing, transplant and disturbance experiment. Twenty plots were randomly placed in each of five dune habitats (white dune, Empetrum dune, grey dune, outer dune heath, inner dune heath), and studied over 2 years. Seedling emergence in control subplots was zero in all habitats, whereas 96% and 98% of the undisturbed and disturbed seeded subplots produced seedlings. Disturbance had a positive effect on emergence and subsequent survival in white dune, outer and inner dune heath. Seedling survival and growth, and growth of transplanted seedlings, were markedly lower in grey dune. These findings indicate that establishment of R. rugosa is seed-limited in coastal dune habitats, and that the species is able to establish in both active and fixed dunes once seeds have arrived. Although differential seedling emergence and growth indicate that habitats differ in their degree of invasion susceptibility by R. rugosa, the positive influence of small-scale disturbance suggests microhabitat limitation in some dune habitats as well. Dune management should aim to reduce seed production and dispersal of R. rugosa in near-natural sites, and anthropogenic changes of habitat dynamics should be prevented.",Web of Science,Rosa rugosa,Denmark,,Baltic coast,,,,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Though none are native, at least 96 aphid species can now be found on one or more of the Hawaiian Islands. As aphids cause direct feeding damage and transmit plant viruses, it is important to identify the traits that have enabled these particular species to successfully colonize the archipelago. To address this question, nine morphological and ecological traits that may contribute to successful colonization were assessed for aphids present in Hawaii. As a comparative null model, we assessed the same traits for heterospecific congeners which are not present in the archipelago, but are present elsewhere in the world. Here we report that traits with higher frequencies among colonizing aphid species are: small apterae size, broad host range, anholocycly (i.e., permanent parthenogenesis), and presence in continental USA. Small aphids arriving from the mainland US and capable of feeding on numerous plant species may be intercepted less often by plant protection agents. It is also likely that asexually reproducing species are well suited to the Hawaiian subtropical climate, thereby eliminating the need for sexual phases and egg-laying for overwintering. By understanding the traits that enable aphids to successfully colonize remote islands, it is our hope that plant protection efforts may be enhanced, thereby reducing damage to native ecosystems.",Web of Science,Many,USA,Hawaii,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,High Reprod.

Evidence from intra- and inter-specific comparisons,journal,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,73,1,138,143,"Shifts in seed mass associated with the process of plant invasion may potentially enhance the competitiveness of introduced species and contribute to invasiveness. Here we test this premise using two complementary approaches. Firstly we compare the seed mass of 114 species from 31 families in both their native and introduced ranges. Secondly we compare the seed mass of 376 co-occurring native and invasive species from two families (Asteraceae and Poaceae) from California. Our results demonstrate that across the 31 families there is a significant tendency for seed mass to increase from the native to invasive ranges. In addition, the analysis on the two families revealed that such a shift in seed mass may contribute to invasive species having, on average, a higher seed mass than co-occurring native species in the same family. Consequently, these results suggest that invasion-associated upward shifts in seed mass may foster plant invasions by increasing the competitiveness of invasive species relative to natives.

The most frequently isolated fungi from both hosts were species of Nigrospora, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Phoma, Epicoccum, Fusarium and Periconia. Most of these occurred at a similar frequency in the two hosts, although Nigrospora sphaerica was much more frequently isolated from H. hirta at both sites. There was little support for the hypothesis that the introduced species (H. hirta) would have a less diverse endophyte community than the native species. There was a greater degree of dominance by the most frequent species in communities from H. hirta than from B. macra, leading to lower diversity indices, but no significant difference in species richness. Cluster analysis of the endophyte communities suggested that host had a greater influence than site on community structure, and that this was expressed mostly in the relative frequency of fungi isolated from stems and leaves, with very similar fungal communities present in the roots of both species at both sites. Analysis of co-occurrence showed no evidence that competition among fungi affected community structure within individual plants. The dominance of N. sphaerica in H. hirta was therefore due to fungus - plant interactions rather than fungus - fungus interactions.

Blake occurs naturally along Australia's eastern coast and has been internationally disseminated for ornamental and agroforestry purposes. We describe the naturalization of M. quinquenervia in the Bahamas and compare stand characteristics to other populations in the exotic tree's native and adventive ranges. Naturalized M. quinquenervia stands were assessed at single locations on Grand Bahama, New Providence and Andros Island. We conclude that M. quinquenervia is at an incipient stage of invasion at these locations, based on the small spatial distribution of stands and the relatively smaller size class distributions at each site. Densities of the M. quinquenervia stands varied dramatically among sites, ranging from 11,800 to 105,800 trees per ha and fell within the range of stands observed in other adventive ranges, including Florida (USA) where the tree is among the most insidious invaders of natural areas. M. quinquenervia trees in the Bahamas have greater biomass dedicated to reproductive structures than other adventive ranges. The number of capsular fruit produced per cm of infructescence is similar among adventive ranges but markedly greater in comparison to its native range of Australia. As a result of invasion, native plant diversity was negatively correlated with increases in M. quinquenervia densities. Consistent with many plant invasions, the most probable seed sources for these naturalized populations are nearby ornamental plantings. We predict that timely implementation of appropriate control tactics at this early stage of invasion with adequate follow-up efforts and continued vigilance will greatly enhance the probability of averting a large scale M. quinquenervia invasion in the Bahamas.",Web of Science,Melaleuca quinquenervia,Bahamas,,,,,Field - Observational,wetland,Subtropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,primary

In mixed species pots, P. fawcettiae had no effect on the biomass of A. millefolium plants, while P. fawcettiae shoot and root biomass per plant decreased when grown with A. millefolium at all densities tested.

Recently, however a striking increase of growing sites and individuals of J. regia has been detected within the Inn valley and other inner Alpine valleys of the Eastern Alps. In addition, climate warming, specifically milder winters since 1970 have been recorded within the study area (Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria). Therefore, a dendroccological study at four study sites in surroundings of Innsbruck dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and/or Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests was initiated to examine more closely, if influence of climate warming favoured spread of this deciduous tree. Together, the four study sites encompassed 30 ha, where in total 651 J regia trees were analysed. Mapping of trees indicated that > 90% grew on south and south-west-facing slopes. Evaluation of the age structure revealed that > 48% of the analysed J. regia trees were younger than 10 years, > 72% younger than 20 years and > 92% younger than 30 years. Analysis of climate conditions in years of germination revealed a striking correspondence between the number of germinated trees and winter (December-February) minimum temperatures (r = 0.43; p < 0.01) and the number of frost days (December-February) < -5 degrees C (r = 0.40; p < 0.01), which can be related to frost sensitivity during seedling stage.

St John, a clonal aquatic macrophyte introduced in Europe, was investigated along a eutrophication gradient in a Northern Vosges stream (NE France). Studies of morphological plasticity in clonal plants have analysed responses to habitat quality in terms of spacer length and branching intensity. The capacity for these parameters to respond to environmental quality has been interpreted as an expression of foraging behaviour, as it confers the potential to intensify the placement of ramets in the more favourable patches of a heterogeneous environment. In our study, the first step consisted in testing the Foraging Concept applied to plant morphology as an adaptation to the acquisition of resources (De Kroon & Hutchings 1995). Eight morphological traits of individuals of E. nuttallii were studied monthly at three sites to document morphological plasticity according to a trophic gradient. A significant difference in morphological traits appeared among the dates and among the sites. A seasonal pattern of the growth of E. nuttallii was established. In agreement with the prediction of the foraging hypothesis, there was a difference in internode and in photosynthetic surface among sites. Plants growing in oligotrophic water were long and thin, while plants growing in mesotrophic water were shorter and more robust, with a greater leaf surface. The second step consisted in investigating the degree of genetic diversity among Elodea nuttallii plants in Northern Vosges streams by analysing twenty-seven samples using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphic (AFLP) markers. Altogether 258 AFLP markers were scored using 5 primer pairs. The average proportion of shared AFLP fragments was higher than 99.80%.

Direct comparison of these co-invasive species in their shared communities therefore is necessary for understanding the ecology of invaded communities, particularly if management resources must be prioritized. We compared ecological characteristics of two of the most important co-invasive herb layer species in forests of the eastern United States, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard, a C-3 biennial herb native to Europe) and Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stilt-grass, a C-4 annual grass native to east Asia). Both are invasive across a wide geographic range, establish dense stands under varying canopy covers, and are associated with lower native herb layer diversity and abundance. However, A. petiolata has attracted much greater attention from the scientific and management communities. Our research had three related components aimed at understanding which species may be a greater threat. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with shaded and unshaded growing conditions, in which M. vimineum grew much greater shoot biomass (although total biomass was similar) and photosynthesis rates for M. vimineum generally exceeded those for A. petiolata. We also did a large field experiment using transplants grown from seed. Microstegium vimineum had greater survivorship, less insect herbivory, larger mass, and higher photosynthesis rates than first-year A. petiolata.

We used multiple regression on resemblance matrices to quantify the relative importance of spatial (e.g. dispersal) and environmental effects on native species composition. Results: Native tree abundance in the smallest size class was unrelated to Ligustrum canopy dominance, while native tree abundance in larger size classes and native liana abundance were negatively correlated with Ligustrum dominance. Native species composition was both environmentally and spatially structured, suggesting that some species are dispersal limited. Seed rain was spatially correlated with conspecific basal area for one of two native species, but not for Ligustrum. Conclusions: Native tree recruitment appears to be limited primarily by sapling mortality in patches dominated by the invasive Ligustrum. Ligustrum does not appear to be dispersal limited in our study area and is likely to continue spreading. Invaded patches may persist for hundreds of years.",Web of Science,Ligustrum lucidum,Argentina,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,primary

Comparison of biological traits with the resident species Ocenebra erinacea,journal,MARINE BIOLOGY,146,1,93,102,"Invasive species impacts on native species and communities have been widely recognised for decades and may involve important economical losses. In this study, we examined two marine muricid gastropods: an invader, Ocinebrellus inornatus, and a resident, Ocenebra erinacea. Both species co-occur on French Atlantic coasts and probably have economical impacts on oyster farming areas of the Charente-Maritime region of France. In previous studies, we investigated the introduction source and the expansion patterns of O. inornatus, using molecular markers. However, these studies are not sufficient to fully understand the expansion dynamics of the exotics. The present framework is devoted to comparing life-history traits between the introduced and resident species. Our results first showed that O. inornatus has more favourable traits, such as a better mean growth rate and a higher reproductive effort, in comparison with O. erinacea. These traits may explain the invader establishment and, partly, its spread along the coast of France. Secondly, the resident species drilled a higher rate of oysters than the invader. Finally, the establishment of O. inornatus in France does not seem to be at the expense of O. erinacea because: (1) resources are not limiting in oyster farming areas and (2) there does not appear to be competition by interference between the species.",Web of Science,Ocinebrellus inornatus,France,,,,,Field - Observational,marine,Intertidal/Near Shore,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Rapid Growth;High Reprod.

We found that: (1) the potentially invasive reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and broadleaf cattail (Typha latifolia) responded to treatments similarly; both outgrew the other perennial species in all four hydrologic regimes; (2) Phalaris had the highest levels of root airspace of all the taxa; (3) the grasses and graminoids nearly always tolerated flooding better than the broadleaf forbs, perhaps in part due to greater quantities of root airspace; and (4) the species that were most sensitive to flooding are typically found in drier, groundwater-fed, and more nutrient-poor environments. We hypothesize that Phalaris and Typha, which are both tall and productive, should be competitive dominants under a variety of hydrologic conditions, at least where nutrients are abundant, as in urban and agricultural landscapes. Eight of the noninvasive taxa tolerated flooding but produced less biomass and/or were shorter or shorter-lived than Phalaris and Typha.

We investigated the individual and combined effects of two predators (the climbing perch, Anabas testudineus, and the wetland crab, Esanthelphusa nimoafi) indigenous to wetlands in Laos, on the behaviour and survival of the invasive South American golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata). The snail is considered a pest, consuming large amounts of rice and other aquatic vegetation in the region. 2. Snail avoidance reactions to released predator chemical cues were investigated in aquaria while the effects of predators on a mixed snail population were studied in field enclosures that contained native aquatic plants (Salvinia cucullata, Ludwigia adscendens and Ipomoea aquatica). 3. In the aquaria experiment, neonate (2-3 mm) and medium-sized snails (8-10 mm) responded to fish chemical cues by going to the surface, whereas adult snails (35-40 mm) went to the bottom. In contrast, no size class of snails reacted to chemical cues released by crabs. 4. In the field experiment, fish reduced the abundance of neonate snails, and crabs reduced the abundance of all size classes. The effect of the combined predators could not be predicted from the mortality rate observed in single predator treatments. The survival of neonate and medium-sized snails was greater and of adults less than expected. The presence of predators did not affect egg production. Snails consumed significant amounts of plants despite the presence of predators. 5. Our findings suggest that some indigenous Asian predators have lethal and sublethal effects on P. canaliculata that depend on snail size and predator type.

We examined the interactive role of habitat alteration (i.e., shoreline development) in driving this invasion and its consequences for plant richness in New England salt marshes. We surveyed 22 salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and quantified shoreline development, Phragmites cover, soil salinity, and nitrogen availability. Shoreline development, operationally defined as removal of the woody vegetation bordering marshes, explained >90% of intermarsh variation in Phragmites cover. Shoreline development was also significantly correlated with reduced soil salinities and increased nitrogen availability, suggesting that removing woody vegetation bordering marshes increases nitrogen availability and decreases soil salinities, thus facilitating Phragmites invasion. Soil salinity (64%) and nitrogen availability (56%) alone explained a large proportion of variation in Phragmites cover, but together they explained 80% of the variation in Phragmites invasion success. Both univariate and aggregate (multidimensional scaling) analyses of plant community composition revealed that Phragmites dominance in developed salt marshes resulted in an almost three-fold decrease in plant species richness. Our findings illustrate the importance of maintaining integrity of habitat borders in conserving natural communities and provide an example of the critical role that local conservation can play in preserving these systems.

The emergence of the alien S. pterophorus was lower than that of the other species, but once established it produced significantly more biomass than the others. The effect of disturbance and water availability on emergence and establishment does not explain the differences in invasive capacity between the two aliens and the native; however, some traits, such as the biomass production of S. pterophorus and the early flowering of S. inaequidens, can contribute to the capacity of the two aliens to colonize new habitats.",Web of Science,Senecio inaequidens;Senecio pterophorus,Spain,,,,,,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

For these demographic scenarios, genetic data obtained from highly variable markers may be profitably combined with specific sampling schemes and information from other sources using a Bayesian approach. The geographic range of the introduced toad Bufo marinus is still expanding in eastern and northern Australia, in each case from isolates established around 1960. A large amount of demographic and historical information is available on both expansion areas. In each area, samples were collected along a transect representing populations of different ages and genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. Five demographic models of expansion, differing in the dispersal pattern for migrants and founders and in the number of founders, were considered. Because the demographic history is complex, we used an approximate Bayesian method, based on a rejection-regression algorithm. to formally test the relative likelihoods of the five models of expansion and to infer demographic parameters. A stepwise migration-foundation model with founder events was statistically better supported than other four models in both expansion areas. Posterior distributions supported different dynamics of expansion in the studied areas. Populations in the eastern expansion area have a lower stable effective population size and have been founded by a smaller number of individuals than those in the northern expansion area. Once demographically stabilized, populations exchange a substantial number of effective migrants per generation in both expansion areas, and such exchanges are larger in northern than in eastern Australia. The effective number of migrants appears to be considerably lower than that of founders in both expansion areas. We found our inferences to be relatively robust to various assumptions on marker. demographic, and historical features. The method presented here is the only robust, model-based method available so far, which allows inferring complex population dynamics over a short time scale.

The muscle-wasting microsporidian parasite Pleistophora mulleri infects the native but not the invader. We found a highly variable prevalence of P. mulleri in uninvaded rivers, with 0-91% of hosts parasitized per sample. In addition, unparasitized natives dominated fast-flowing riffle patches of river, whereas parasitized individuals dominated slower-flowing, pooled patches. We examined the survivorship of invader and native in single and mixed-species microcosms with high, intermediate, and zero parasite prevalence. G. pulex survivorship was high in all treatments, whereas G. duebeni subsp. celticus survivorship was significantly lower in the presence of the invader. Further, parasitized G. duebeni subsp. celticus experienced near-total elimination. Models of the species replacement process implied that parasite-enhanced IGP would make invasion by G. pulex more likely, regardless of habitat and parasite spatial structure. However, where heterogeneity in parasite prevalence creates a landscape of patches with different susceptibilities to invasion, G. pulex may succeed in cases where invasion would not be possible if patches were equivalent.

The ratio of quagga mussel biomass to zebra mussel biomass on the canal wall is correlated with depth, and quagga mussels constitute > 99% of dreissenid biomass on bottom sediments. This dominance shift did not substantially affect the total dreissenid biomass, which has remained at 3 to 5 kg fresh mass /m(2) on the canal walls for nearly a decade.

Some have 'escaped' gardens and have naturalized in human-disturbed areas as weeds, adventives, or ruderal species. A few species have successfully invaded secondary and relatively undisturbed native wet forests. This paper reviews the naturalized alien acanths in tropical islands, and focuses on the currently invasive and potentially invasive species. This study is based on recent (1994-2004) botanical surveys and field observations conducted in several tropical oceanic islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and on bibliographical searches of other tropical islands and countries. A total of 52 acanth species are naturalized in the Indo-Pacific islands; 26 of them are native to Asia, 18 to tropical America, and only 8 to Africa. The number of naturalized acanths in selected tropical oceanic and continental islands varied from 7 to 25 species and the rate of naturalized acanths (number of naturalized species/number of introduced species) from 27% to 62%. We recorded eight major invasive species: the erect herbs or shrubs Justicia carnea, Odontonema strictum, Phlogacanthus turgidus, Sanchezia speciosa and Strobilanthes hamiltonianus form dense monospecific thickets in the understorey of wet forests; the woody vine Thunbergia grandiflora smothers native trees; the creeping herb Hemigraphis alternata forms dense carpets that totally cover the ground; and the herb Ruellia brevifolia colonizes the understorey of closed-canopy wet forest. We also discuss eight potentially or incipient invasive acanths which are subspontaneous or sparingly naturalized, but which are not yet considered invasive. Most of the currently invasive acanths are sterile, the lack of fruit production being explained by the absence of pollinators and/or to their particular floral structure and reproduction modes. They reproduce vegetatively by stem fragmentation or by root suckers, and their range expansion is thus relatively slow. Their success may be attributed to their long (50-100 years) residence times, and long-distance dispersal by humans. Many potentially invasive acanths are newly introduced ornamentals that produce seeds, thus constituting potentially greater threats. The Acanthaceae is not yet recognized as an 'aggressive' plant family (e.g. compared to the Fabaceae, Melastomataceae, Poaceae, or Rosaceae). It is, however, one of the most popular ornamental families in the Tropics, and should receive more attention because of the increasing number of current and incipient invasive species found in tropical islands.",Web of Science,Many,Indo-pacific islands,,,,,,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Other,Clonal Reproduction,primary

Above-ground biomass (an estimate of fecundity), height and basal diameter were lower in the northern populations which were first to produce flowers. Some differences were also observed in biomass allocation to leaves, flowers and fruits, albeit without a latitudinal pattern. The latitudinal trends in growth and survival disappeared in a field experiment, probably due to suboptimal site conditions. Most variation in plant traits was explained by differences among regions with some minor effects of populations within regions. Besides latitude, no other geographical, climatic or population trait correlated with the observed differences in growth and phenology. Differences in latitude may mainly represent variation in length of the growing season.

We studied the correlation between alien weeds and native species, dividing the latter group into weedy and non-weedy species, integrating various factors that influence diversity into an analysis on the scale of the federal states of Mexico. The resulting multiple-regression models for native and alien weed species are robust (adjusted R(2) = 0.87 and R(2) = 0.69, respectively) and show a strong partial correlation of the number of weed species (native and alien) with the number of non-weed native species. These results agree with studies showing a positive correlation between the number of native and alien species on larger scales. Both models also include human population density as an important predictor variable, but this is more important for alien weeds (beta = 0.62) than for native weeds (beta = 0.32). In the regression model for native weed species richness, the non-cultivated (fallow) area (beta = 0.24) correlated positively with native weed richness.

Controlled pollination experiments carried out on 17 invasive alien plant species in South Africa revealed that 100% were either self-compatible or apomictic, and that 72% of these were capable of autonomous self pollination. The distribution of breeding systems among these invasive aliens is thus strongly skewed towards uniparental reproduction. While all 13 woody species in our survey showed a capacity for uniparental reproduction, this mode of reproduction is very rare among woody plants in general. Thus Baker's rule, which has generally been considered for short-lived herbaceous plants, may also apply to invasive shrubs and trees. The study species exhibited high levels of fruit set (median = 71.5%). Supplemental hand-pollination experiments carried out on five of the species showed that pollen availability did not limit fruit set. Further work is needed to establish the exact role of uniparental reproduction in various stages of the invasion process. In particular, we need to know whether uniparental reproduction provides reproductive assurance at the population establishment stage (as originally envisaged by Baker) or whether it plays a further role in alleviating pollen limitation in small and established populations.",Web of Science,Many,South Africa,,,,,Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Effective Disperser,primary

We consider invasion patterns related to two aspects of the invasion process: the spread of a species in Germany as counted by the number of occupied grid cells, and the degree of naturalization in Germany (i.e. whether a plant species is exclusively naturalized in human-made habitats or also in (semi-)natural habitats). Although in Germany the area of natural habitats is smaller than that of human-made habitats, the area of occupancy of the respective alien plant species is the opposite. We tested whether both patterns could be explained by niche-breadth variables, namely the number of inhabited habitat types, and vegetation formations, the range of human impact levels, the number of inhabited continents, the number of inhabited floristic zones (climatic zones), and the amplitude of oceanity. Tests were conducted across species and across phylogenetically-independent contrasts, using generalized linear models, in particular, hierarchical partitioning. The number of occupied grid cells could be explained by niche-breadth variables, especially by number of habitats, number of formations, and amplitude of oceanity. Contrary to our expectations, none of these variables could explain the degree of naturalization in cross-species analyses, and amplitude of oceanity is the only stably significant variable that explains the degree of naturalization when analysing phylogenetically-independent contrasts. We conclude that the degree of naturalization is probably independent from niche breadth, and that properties of a larger area of occupancy, i.e. sample size (or propagule pressure), could be responsible for this pattern.",Web of Science,Many,Germany,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,primary

A species may become invasive when a new site provides the potential for positive rates of population growth. This may be the case of several Agave species introduced to Spain in the 1940s. In this paper we document factors that promote large increases of populations of these species, and their effects on native plant communities in two sites of SE Spain. Results showed higher rhizome and bulbil production, and higher establishment rates by agaves in sandy soils than in clay soils. In their native habitats, agaves have low establishment rates and sandy soils are rare. This suggests that sandy soils are an opportunity which releases the clonal reproduction of Agave. The effects of agaves on the physiological performance and reproduction of native species were negative, positive or neutral, depending on the size and rooting depth of neighbours. Assemblages of native species growing within Agave stands had lower diversity than non-invaded sites.

By re- analysis of pollen pellets collected by locally-adapted ( Mexican) European honey bees for one year, at the same experimental sites and using the same pollen traps as our studies, before the arrival of invasive honey bees in S.

We examined genetic variation in allozymes of 20 C. hirta populations on four Hawaiian Islands to determine the introduction history. For comparison, we measured genetic variation in 20 native populations across Costa Rica. Mean levels of genetic variation in Hawaiian and Costa Rican populations were low compared to other woody or introduced plants (11.5-12.5% polymorphic loci, 2.05-2.50 alleles per polymorphic locus, and 0.045-0.063 expected heterozygosity). Most genetic diversity was held within rather than among populations in both areas (G(ST) = 0.120 and 0.271 in Hawaii and Costa Rica, respectively). Hawaiian populations had a high degree of genetic similarity, and no genetic differentiation was found among the four Hawaiian Islands sampled. These patterns of genetic variation in Hawaii suggest that no intraspecific hybridization of genotypes from different parts of the native range has occurred and that introductions to the different islands came from the same or similar source populations. The low levels of genetic diversity in parts of both the native and introduced ranges suggest that genetic variation is unrelated to invasiveness in C. hirta.",Web of Science,Clidemia hirta,USA,Hawaii,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Tropical Forest,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution in General,,primary

Considering trophic guilds, significant positive correlations were found between M. senhousia and detritivores and herbivores, while suspension feeders probably suffered competition from the mussel.

Are there any differences in habitat preferences among three closely related Reynoutria taxa? 4. How does the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations change along the course of a river? Location: River Jizera basin, north Bohemia, Czech Republic. Methods: Nine 0.25 km(2) plots were chosen along the river. Within each plot all main habitat types were determined and sampled using the Braun-Blanquet scale to determine the invasibility of various communities. The patches invaded by Reynoutria taxa and surrounding Reynoutria-free vegetation in the same habitat type were sampled as releve pairs to compare the composition of invaded and non-invaded vegetation. In addition, to characterize the genetic structure of Reynoutria populations along the river, 30 samples front different clones were collected. Results and conclusions: 1. The species richness of communities has no influence on the success of Reynoutria invasion in the area studied. The combination of environmental conditions and propagule spread is more important to the invasion success than the number of species in the host community. 2. Reynoutria invasion greatly reduces species diversity. 3. R. japonica invaded more habitat types than R. sachalinensis and R. X bohemica. The hybrid R. x bohemica outcompetes the parental taxa at sites where both taxa co-occur. 4. Isozyme analysis revealed phenotype variability in the hybrid in contrast to the parental taxa. Different hybrid phenotypes are distributed randomly on the middle and lower reaches of the River Jizera; one of them dominates and the other three occur occasionally.

Since then it has become an aggressive weed, and an unexpected degree of genetic and genome size variation has been detected; features that might result from interspecies hybridization. We investigated the possibility that H. pilosella has hybridized with related taxa. Of the four other subgenus Pilosella species introduced to New Zealand, H. praealtum is the most abundant and, on morphological and distributional evidence, most likely to be the other parent. Flow cytometry was used to estimate relative genome size for 156 Hieracium plants collected from the wild. Plants assigned to either parental or hybrid morphotypes were found to comprise tetraploid and pentaploid individuals using genome size measurements, and this was confirmed with direct mitotic chromosome counts for a subset of plants. The haploid DNA content of H. praealtum was approximately 22% larger than that of H. pilosella. Putative hybrids that were tetraploid had mean genome sizes equivalent to two H. pilosella and two H. praealtum haploid chromosome sets, implying they were hybrids arising from the fertilization of two reduced gametes. Similar results were obtained from tetraploid hybrids produced by controlled pollination. However, the majority of field hybrids were pentaploid with a genome size equivalent to four H. pilosella and one H. praealtum haploid chromosome sets. We infer that these are not first-generation hybrids but represent successful backcrossing with H. pilosella and/or hybrid-hybrid crossing, and that sexual tetraploid hybrids have been the parents.

Stem flow was measured with Granier type thermal dissipation probes. Sap flux, normalized per unit sapwood area, and the total sapwood areas of the particular trees were used to estimate daily transpiration. Maximum daily transpiration values (60 kg water) were recorded for Croton when at full foliage. After shedding most of its leaves in the dry season transpiration was reduced to 8 kg per day. Eucalyptus had the next highest transpiration (55 kg), in this case at the peak of the dry season. It transpired 4-5 times more than Podocarpus and Cupressus trees of similar size. Maximum stem flux density was tree-size dependent only in Croton. Diurnal patterns of stem flux indicated that Croton, Eucalyptus and Podocarpus, in contrast to Cupressus, responded more directly to light than to atmospheric water pressure deficit. At high VPD (>1.0 kPa) stem flux reached a plateau in Croton and Podocarpus indicating stomatal limitation. Per unit leaf area Croton had the highest and Podocarpus and Cupressus the lowest daily transpiration rates.

Methods Variation in response to increasing periods of vernalization as seeds or seedlings for progeny of ten full-sib families from each of four B. tectorum populations from contrasting habitats was studied. Key Results As vernalization was increased from 0 to 10 weeks, the proportion of plants flowering within 20 weeks increased, weeks to initiation of flowering decreased, and seed yield per plant increased, regardless of whether plants were vernalized as seeds or seedlings. Most of the variation was accounted for by differences among populations. Plants of the warm desert population flowered promptly even without vernalization, while those of the cold desert, foothill and montane populations showed incremental changes in response variables as a function of vernalization period. Populations differed in among-family variance, with the warm desert population generally showing the least variance and the cold desert population the most. Variation among populations and among families within populations decreased as vernalization period increased, whereas the non-genetic component of variance showed no such pattern.

Invasive species dominate many ecosystems but the competitive strategies underlying this dominance are unclear. Are invasive species generalist competitors, or do they only thrive in certain environments? Do they occur mainly post-disturbance or can they persist throughout succession? 2. We tested the relative importance of resource acquisition (competitive suppression ability) and the ability to tolerate reduced resource levels (competitive tolerance ability) among four C3 perennial grass species in an invaded oak savanna. Two species (Poa pratensis and Dactylis glomerata) are exotic invaders and are thought to have replaced the two native species (Bromus carinatus and Elymus glaucus) as dominants. 3. Using glasshouse and field experiments we tested whether the two strategies were maintained with changing resource levels and successional conditions, and their relative roles in explaining exotic dominance. 4. The relative importance of suppression- and tolerance-based competition shifted with neighbour density, burning and planting order. Further, the relative importance of particular plant traits changed depending on the imposed conditions, and the exotic dominants were only competitively superior under certain circumstances. 5. Competitive suppression ability was maintained with changing resource levels but was confined to post-disturbance conditions. When planting of neighbours was delayed, the early establishing targets were dominant regardless of species, fertility and neighbour density. 6. Competitive tolerance ability determined long-term patterns of relative abundance and coexistence, but only under the current field conditions of low fertility and limited disturbance. Alteration of these conditions changed the relative abundance of the four grasses, and would probably reconfigure species patterns in the oak savanna community generally. 7. Exotic dominance is presently determined by tolerance-based competitive traits interacting with the long-term absence of disturbance. Dominance is therefore contingent on the interaction of competitive strategies, resource availability and disturbance history rather than any one factor alone. 8. Exotic flora dominate all stages of succession in this savanna because there exists both early (suppression) and late (tolerance) successional specialists. The identity of the dominant changes with succession based on the competitive strategy it employs.

It is suspected to be monoclonal so, its remarkable success may be due in part to great phenotypic plasticity. On Reunion, bud, flower, fruit and seed production, the duration of the flowering period and the importance of the seed bank were found to be negatively correlated with elevation (50-1500 m a.s.l.).

This pattern is consistent with a stratified dispersal process combining long-distance movements and local diffusion. 2. Using large-scale spatial data on damage caused by Cameraria ohridella in Germany, three stochastic spatial models of spread are compared: a diffusion model, a leptokurtic dispersal model and a stratified dispersal model that assumes a two-scale dispersal process. In addition, the association between human population and moth invasion is tested in this last model by linking long-distance infestation probability to human population density. Finally, these spatial models constructed with data from Germany are tested at the European scale and compared to historical records of first occurrence. 3. The fat-tailed dispersal kernel models (leptokurtic and stratified dispersal models) allowing for long-distance dispersal provide better predictions than the diffusion model. Among these models, the stratified dispersal model incorporating the effect of human population density provides the best description of the spread of Cameraria ohridella in Germany in predictive (lowest sum of squared errors) and qualitative (similar fractal dimension) terms. 4. The roles of short-distance and long-distance dispersal in Cameraria ohridella invasion ecology in relation to human population are discussed, together with the models' scale-dependence and limitations.",Web of Science,Cameraria ohridella,Germany,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Urban,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Disturbance,Effective Disperser,primary

It has been speculated that overgrazing by an increasing number of cattle, lack of grazing in abandoned areas, or large-scale changes in environmental conditions may be the reason for this invasion. This study focuses on ecological and ecophysiological aspects of Vochysia divergens (cambara), a flood-tolerant tree that began spreading in the Pantanal during the last 30 years and is considered a very aggressive invasive plant. The study shows that the spread of cambard can be related to natural multi-years wet periods. During multi-years dry periods the species is reduced by the increasing impact of fires in the Pantanal. This points to the great importance of multi-years climatic events on the vegetation cover of the Pantanal and indicates a very dynamic development in plant communities.",Web of Science,Vochysia divergens,Brazil,Mato Grosso,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Exploring the characteristics of non-native fishes across invasion stages in California,journal,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,49,5,646,661,"1. The global spread of non-native species is a major concern for ecologists, particularly in regards to aquatic systems. Predicting the characteristics of successful invaders has been a goal of invasion biology for decades. Quantitative analysis of species characteristics may allow invasive species profiling and assist the development of risk assessment strategies. 2. In the current analysis we developed a data base on fish invasions in catchments throughout California that distinguishes among the establishment, spread and integration stages of the invasion process, and separates social and biological factors related to invasion success. 3. Using Akaike's information criteria (AIC), logistic and multiple regression models, we show suites of biological variables, which are important in predicting establishment (parental care and physiological tolerance), spread (life span, distance from nearest native source and trophic status) and abundance (maximum size, physiological tolerance and distance from nearest native source). Two variables indicating human interest in a species (propagule pressure and prior invasion success) are predictors of successful establishment and prior invasion success is a predictor of spread and integration. 4.

Then, one expects that adapted genotypes become dominant and genotypic and genetic diversity should decrease with time. We investigated genotypic and genetic diversity within recently founded and established populations of the common weed Cirsium arvense. We used highly polymorphic amplified fragments length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. All populations were multiclonal and highly diverse ( the proportion of distinguishable genotypes was 0.73 +/- 0.25 [mean +/- SD]). Clonal evenness was variable and ranged from 0.2 to 1. Independent of successional stage, we found on the small geographic scale of our study (< 5 km) a considerable differentiation between populations (&UPhi;(SC) = 0.63). This amount of differentiation was similar between founder and established populations and could result from selection in the early stage of succession as well as founder effects. Contrary to the general expectation, genotypic and genetic diversity were maintained through time, and molecular variance did not differ between successional stages (1.9 &PLUSMN; 0.89 vs. 2.5 &PLUSMN; 1.41). We suggest that this pattern is a consequence of the particular reproductive system of C. arvense that combines clonality with dioecy. The combination of clonal reproduction with the recruitment of sexually outcrossed seedlings in the first years allows the species to perform efficient colonizations even with founder effects, to undergo selection without loss of diversity, and to persist locally. This strategy appears to be very efficient in C. arvense and may have contributed to the worldwide success of this species.",Web of Science,Cirsium arvens,USA,,,,,,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Clonal Reproduction,primary

Many theoretical and observational studies suggest that diverse communities are more resistant to invasion by exotic species than less diverse ones. However, experimental results do not always support such a relationship. Therefore, the hypothesis of diversity-community invasibility is still a focus of controversy in the field of invasion ecology. In this study, we established and manipulated communities with different species diversity and different species functional groups (16 species belong to C-3, C-4, forbs and legumes, respectively) to test Elton's hypothesis and other relevant hypotheses by studying the process of invasion. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) was chosen as the invader. We found that the correlation between the decrement of extractable soil nitrogen and biomass of alligator weed was not significant, and that species diversity, independent of functional groups diversity, did not show a significant correlation with invasibility. However, the communities with higher functional groups diversity significantly reduced the biomass of alligator weed by decreasing its resource opportunity. Functional traits of species also influenced the success of the invasion. Alternanthera sessilis, in the same morphological and functional group as alligator weed, was significantly resistant to alligator weed invasion. Because community invasibility is influenced by many factors and interactions among them, the pattern and mechanisms of community invasibility are likely to be far subtler than we found in this study.

Results from field survey on the representative vegetation types, Quercus acutissima and Q. mongolica communities in lowland and upland, respectively, show that black locust have invaded other vegetation beyond originally planted zones in lowland but not the upland vegetation. Black locust occurs from the bases to summits of mountains in the urban centers, whereas its range is restricted to mountain bases in urban outskirts and rural areas. Although native oaks (Quercus spp.) are usually succeeding black locust colonies, changes to native vegetation are often interrupted by frequent disturbance by human activities, as evident from persistent sprouts and expansions of black locust suckers in the disturbed areas, such as urban center and rural areas. Responses of the black locust plantation in terms of stand dynamics to different disturbance intensities also reflected such trends.

Experiments on larval competition between North American populations of the two species showed that A. albopictus has the competitive advantage under local field conditions, which apparently accounts for displacement of A. aegypti from much of the United States after the invasion of A. albopictus. The role of competition, and potential shifts of competitive advantage in different parts of their worldwide ranges are unknown, but variation due to intraspecific or environmental differences is possible. In the current study, we measured the performance of larvae of Brazilian populations of A. albopictus and A. aegypti competing under field conditions in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Finite rates of increase for each species were estimated and the effects of species composition, larval density, and leaf litter resource levels were determined. A. albopictus maintained positive population growth at higher combined densities and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. A. albopictus showed higher survivorship than A. aegypti under all treatments and leaf litter resource levels. These results indicate that in Brazil, just as in North America, A. albopictus is a superior larval competitor to A. aegypti when exploiting leaf litter resources.

Three haplotypes (A, D, G) were found in seven, three, and four species, respectively, but two species (H. lactucella and H. auricula) had single, private haplotypes.

Radiating from sites of deliberate introduction, S. alterniflora and hybrids now cover ca. 190 ha, mainly in the South and Central Bay.

Answering this question is a key goal of invasion biology because it underlies whether we can make progress via comparative studies or must instead cope with a large set of unique cases. Here we quantify similarities and differences in the historical development of normative fish assemblages of two North American desert drainages, one with many normative fishes (Gila Basin, principally southwestern USA), and one with few (Yaqui Basin, principally northwestern Mexico). The two river basins are similar in size, physiography, and ecology, but because of differences in the timing of regional development, we hypothesized that richness and geographic spread of normative fishes in the Yaqui are time-lagged relative to the Gila, and that a slow, but steady increase of normative fish occurrence is underway in the Yaqui, similar to what has already occurred in the Gila. Using the comprehensive SONFISHES database, we found that increases in the regional richness of extant normative species over time have been roughly linear in both basins. Meanwhile, previously established species have continued to spread spatially, such that the cumulative number of reach records for normative species has increased roughly exponentially in both systems. The current status of normatives in the Yaqui is remarkably similar to what was evident from the Gila in the past at a comparable level of sampling effort. For all measures of invasion dynamics we examined, a time lag of similar to 40-50 years exists between the Gila and Yaqui. The majority of extant normative fishes are known piscivores, and many have high levels of parental care, a life history trait that affords considerable advantages over native fishes. These results predict that, absent strong action now, the presently abundant native fish fauna of the Yaqui may become increasingly imperiled over the next several years, with a future similar to the Gila, where most native fishes are either extirpated, threatened, or substantially reduced in range, at least partially due to normative fishes.

Our aim was to test whether the variation in invasive ability can be partly explained by a specific life-history trait, desiccation tolerance, which might be important in view of the typical instability of tropical freshwater habitats. We therefore tested desiccation tolerance in both juveniles and adults under laboratory conditions. Our data show that, although all Thiarid lines resist desiccation quite well, they exhibit extreme variation in the degree of tolerance. These differences are mostly mediated by individual size, but are definitely of genetic origin given that our individuals were of similar ages and were raised under standardized laboratory conditions. The overall invasive success of a line in Martinique, deduced from field surveys, does not correlate with its desiccation tolerance. However, desiccation tolerance does seem to be a limiting factor for the invasion of the small fraction of habitats that are most exposed to drought.

Increased invasion of P. arundinacea stands caused few effects on the dominant, as R arundinacea biomass was unaffected after the first year. Selective herbivory by deer of species other than R arundinacea increased the effects of disturbance and seeding, and aided in continued dominance of the grass.

Soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates were strongly related to the degree of site invasion (F = 30.2, P < 0.0001 and F = 11.8, P < 0.005, respectively), and leaf C : N ratios were negatively correlated with invasion (R-2 = 0.22, P < 0.0001). More surprisingly, there was a strong positive relationship between soil calcium levels and the degree of site invasion (partial r = 0.70, P < 0.01), and there were also positive relationships between invasion and soil magnesium and phosphorus. We found, in addition, a positive factor-ceiling relationship between native species diversity and invasive species diversity. This positive relationship between native and invasive diversity contradicts earlier hypotheses concerning the relationships between species diversity and invasion, but supports some recent findings.

Invaders were significantly more abundant in mixed hardwood than in pine barrens communities (Mann-Whitney U = 682.5, P < 0.0001). Even when evaluating the mixed hardwood communities alone, invasion remained significantly positively correlated with soil fertility (calcium. magnesium, and net nitrogen mineralization rates).

This study determined. whether low- and high-density cheat-grass (Bromus tectorum L.) patches within a shadscale-bunchgrass community of western Utah, USA, can be explained by variation in resource availability. It also explored the possible role of seed limitation and enemy pressure on invasion patterns. Two parallel field experiments were conducted: (1) increasing resources within low-density cheatgrass patches and, conversely; (2) reducing resources within high-density cheatgrass patches. Treatments were applied at three life stages separately and across all stages. In low-density cheatgrass patches (assumed to represent high resistance), a disturbance that reduced soil compaction had the strongest positive effect, significantly increasing biomass by 250% and density by 104% in comparison to the control. The second strongest effect was reducing neighbors (native grasses), which significantly increased cheatgrass biomass and density. These results indicate that resources are present in low-density cheatgrass patches, but they are unavailable without disturbance and/or are exploited by competitors, and hence represent resistance to invasion. In high-density cheatgrass patches (assumed to represent low resistance), nitrogen availability was important in maintaining cheatgrass densities. Reducing nitrogen (via sucrose addition) significantly decreased density (by 37%) but not biomass. Life stages of cheatgrass were differentially affected by these resource manipulations. In addition, herbivore (primarily grasshoppers) and pathogen (head smut) pressures were documented to affect cheatgrass density, but did not explain resistance patterns. Instead, we found that differential resource availability explains the observed variation in cheatgrass density, and variation in natural resistance.",Web of Science,Bromus tectorum ,USA,Utah,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

Increased disturbance caused by human impacts is hypothesized as a primary factor promoting the spread of invaders. Plants and plant litter can have important effects on plant colonization and community composition by affecting seedling survival and growth. I examined the hypothesis that invasion of non-native Lythrum salicaria in Typha-dominated marshes is disturbance-dependent. If so, the removal of Typha plants or litter would increase the survival and growth of L. salicaria seedlings. Additionally, the removal of both plants and litter could result in an additive or synergistic effect on the establishment of L. salicaria. Alternatively, L. salicaria may be a successful invader because it has a high capacity to establish and grow regardless of neighbours. In this case, L. salicaria would be expected to perform well even in plants and litter. Strategies for managing L. salicaria will depend on which factors promote invasion. I measured the differential effects of plants and litter, alone and in combination. on the survival and growth of L. salicaria seedlings transplanted into marshes. The presence of plants and litter did not affect seedling survival in relatively dry wetland sites, indicating that L. salicaria seedlings have the capacity to persist in the presence of neighbouring Typha spp. competitors. However, removal of both plants and litter allowed increased growth of L. salicaria seedlings in drier wetlands. Therefore, growth was facilitated by disturbance that removed all vegetation. Small disturbances (0.6 m(2)) decreased competitive suppression by native Typha spp. neighbours and resulted in significant increases in growth. Disturbance of wetlands at risk of invasion by L. salicaria should be avoided.",Web of Science,Lythrum salicaria,USA,MInnesota,,,,Field - Experimental,wetland,Wetland,Invasion Hyp.,Disturbance,,primary

However, if an invasive is already well established then experimental research is necessary to provide the information necessary to effectively manage the species. Prescribing appropriate management strategies without prior experimental research may not only be ineffective but also may squander limited resources or have the unintended consequence of furthering spread. Lespedeza cuneata (Dum. Cours.) G. Don. is a well-established invasive plant of old fields and tall-grass prairie in the US. Managers suspect this species shades-out native plants and this is proposed as its primary mechanism for dominance. Using field experiments we tested probable factors allowing the species to establish itself and, once established, interfere in old field plant communities. We also examined the effects of two common anthropogenic disturbances (mowing and nutrients) on L. cuneata growth and establishment. When L. cuneata was treated (clipping, herbicide and stem pull-back) there was a significant increase in species richness and native species cover. Stem density and canopy cover of L. cuneata increased significantly with mowing frequency but-decreased with nutrient input. We suggest that mowing benefits L. cuneata while also hindering woody competition. Results also indicate L. cuneata is less prevalent on nutrient enriched soils than on unamended soil. Lespedeza cuneata appears to suppress native plants by shading them out and it can subsequently take over grassland communities. Since it has a varying response to human induced disturbances and may actually benefit from mowing, land managers should be cautious when utilizing this as a management tool.",Web of Science,lespedeza cuneata,USA,,,,,Field - Observational,terrestrial,Old Field,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Disturbance,Rapid Growth,primary

The primary measures of 'invasion' in these and other studies are invader richness and the absolute cover or biomass of invaders. We argue that the relative biomass or cover of invaders (dominance) is an important but overlooked measure of plant invasion. We re-analyzed data presented in five previous studies to evaluate whether exotic relative abundance is positively correlated with native richness. There were either no relationships or negative relationships between native richness and relative exotic cover calculated from three spatial scales (1, 1000 and 4000 m(2)). Thus while the original studies reported high exotic richness or absolute cover in habitats rich in native species, native richness did not predict the degree to which exotics had become dominant or abundant relative to natives. Absolute measures of exotic cover reported in the original studies underestimated relative exotic cover in habitats with low native species richness. High exotic dominance in areas of low native richness may indicate that exotic richness and dominance are controlled by different factors. We conclude that it is useful for researchers to measure both invader richness and invader dominance when trying to understand the environmental factors that are associated with plant invasions.",Web of Science,Many,USA,,,,,Statistical/Meta-analysis,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

In this study, I compared aspects of L. humile's colony structure, including density, the spatial pattern of nests and trails, and patterns of intraspecific aggression in parts of the introduced and native ranges. I also compared the number of ant species coexisting with L. humile. Introduced and native populations did not differ significantly in nest density, ant density, nest size, and nearest-neighbor distances. In three of the four study populations in the native range and all of the study populations in the introduced range, colonies were organized into supercolonies: they consisted of multiple, interconnected nests that were dense and spatially clumped, and aggression among conspecifics was rare. In one population in the native range, colonies were organized differently: they occupied single nest sites, nests were sparse and randomly dispersed, and ants from neighboring nests were aggressive toward each other. Species richness was significantly higher in the native range than in the introduced range, even in areas where L. humile formed dense supercolonies.

However, the long caudal appendage (spine) of Bythotrephes protects it against young-of-the-year (YOY)fish predation. After experience, small fish (30-60 mm TL) develop aversion behavior, explaining why this prey item rarely occurs in their stomachs, despite ingestion of other prey species with core body lengths between 2-3 mm. Here we compare laboratory and field size-dependent feeding patterns for YOY of two common fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens; bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus) with field patterns from a typical bait-fish species (spottail shiner, Notropis hudsonius). Behavioral responses of bluegills indicate that deterrence is not a simple linear function of spine length, but that longer spines offer disproportionate protection, explaining why long spines are present at birth. Stomach contents of small perch (30-60 mm TL) confirm size-dependent avoidance, with only occasional consumption of Bythotrephes and rare puncture of stomach walls. However, examples of ingestion and frequent stomach puncture were found in the thinner-walled stomachs of spottail shiners.

P. punctata was first described from Eastern Australia, although its native habitat probably extends across Northern Australia and into SE Asia. Among invasive marine species, P. punctata has a relatively well-documented history of invading tropical and subtropical environments. Despite this, there is no direct evidence of translocation routes or the mechanisms by which translocation has occurred. The invasion of the Northern Gulf of Mexico has been theorized to represent an inevitable distributional shift of an invasive hub population in the Caribbean Sea facilitated by periodic oceanographic connections between the regions, or by the transportation of benthic scyphistomae on the hulls of ships. Regardless of the translocation mechanism, the relatively close geographical proximity of the Caribbean to the Northern Gulf of Mexico makes this theory conceptually appealing. Based on a 'hub and spoke' model of marine bio-invasion, we postulated that populations of P. punctata from regions more geographically distant than those from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico have been separated for longer periods of time; therefore, populations from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico would bear greater morphological similarity to each other than to those of other regions due to higher levels of underlying genetic relatedness. We used multivariate analyses to compare the morphological similarity of 6 populations of R punctata distributed between the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean and the east and west coasts of Australia. Contrary to our expectations, analyses showed that populations from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico are the least similar to each other.

Root and shoot biomass production did not differ significantly among the four groups. A progressively marked stomatal closure was observed in drought-stressed seedlings, leading to homeostasis of leaf water potential, which was maintained well above the turgor loss point.

When scaled by leaf surface area, shoot hydraulic conductance did not differ among the treated seedlings, whereas root hydraulic conductance decreased by about 20% in S I and S2 seedlings and by about 70% in S3 seedlings, with respect to the well-watered control value. Similar differences were observed when root hydraulic conductance was scaled by root surface area, suggesting that roots had become less permeable to water. Anatomical observations of root cross sections revealed that S3 seedlings had shrunken cortical cells and a multilayer endodermal-like tissue that probably impaired soil-to-root stele water transport.

The beetle is native to eastern Asia and has become an invasive pest in North America and Europe, stimulating interest in delineating host and non-host tree species more clearly. When offered a choice among four species of living trees in a greenhouse, adult A. glabripennis fed more on golden-rain tree (Koelreuteria paniculata Laxmann) and river birch (Betula nigra L.) than on London planetree (Platanus x acerifolia (Aiton) Willdenow) or callery pear (Pyrus calleryana Decaisne). Oviposition rate was highest in golden-rain tree, but larval mortality was also high and larval growth was slowest in this tree species. Oviposition rate was lowest in callery pear, and larvae failed to survive in this tree species, whether they eclosed from eggs laid in the trees or were manually inserted into the trees. Adult beetles feeding on callery pear had a reduced longevity and females feeding only on callery pear failed to develop any eggs. The resistance of golden-rain tree against the larvae appears to operate primarily through the physical mechanism of abundant sap flow. The resistance of callery pear against both larvae and adults appears to operate through the chemical composition of the tree, which may include compounds that are toxic or which otherwise interfere with normal growth and development of the beetle. Unlike river birch or London planetree, both golden-rain tree and callery pear are present in the native range of A. glabripennis and may therefore have developed resistance to the beetle by virtue of exposure to attack during their evolutionary history.",Web of Science,Anoplophora glabripennis,,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Empty Niche,,herbivore

However, with the increased availability of GIS software and spatially explicit data, the distribution of invasive alien plants can be explored. Using bioregions as defined in Hickman (1993), I compared the distribution of invasive alien plants (n = 78) and noninvasive alien plants (n = 1097). The distribution of both categories of alien plants was similar with the exception of a higher concentration of invasive alien plants in the North Coast bioregion. Spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I indicated significant spatial dependence for both invasive and noninvasive alien plant species. I used both ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial autoregressive (SAR) models to assess the relationship between alien plant species distribution and native plant species richness, road density, population density, elevation, area of sample unit, and precipitation. The OLS model for invasive alien plants included two significant effects; native plant species richness and elevation. The SAR model for invasive alien plants included three significant effects; elevation, road density, and native plant species richness. The SAR model for noninvasive alien plants resulted in the same significant effects as invasive alien plants. Both invasive and noninvasive alien plants are found in regions with low elevation, high road density, and high native-plant species richness. This is in congruity with previous spatial pattern studies of alien plant species. However, the similarity in effects for both categories of alien plants alludes to the importance of autecological attributes, such as pollination system, dispersal system and differing responses to disturbance in the distribution of invasive plant species.

Yellow starthistle (YST) roots removed from four sites in southern France were washed in distilled water. Individual bacterial colonies were isolated from the root wash and plated on nutrient agar. Sixteen isolates were grown on two different media for 1 week at 25degreesC at either 150 or 250 rpm. The resulting culture was centrifuged and the supernatant adjusted to pH 7.2. The effect of the cell-free filtrates on the germination of YST seeds from France and the United States were tested by placing seeds on filter paper moistened with the bacterial filtrate in Petri plates. Five isolates showed some inhibition dependent upon the shaker speed and media used. Isolates 2(8) and 3(11) shaking at 250 rpm and 1(10) and 4(15) shaking at 150 rpm reduced germination of only French YST seeds.

We propose using game theory and the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) as a conceptual framework for integrating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of invasions. We suggest that the pathways by which a recipient community may have no ESS provide mechanistic hypotheses for how such communities may be vulnerable to invasion and how invaders can exploit these vulnerabilities. We distinguish among these pathways by formalizing the evolutionary contexts of the invader relative to the recipient community. We model both the ecological and the adaptive dynamics of the interacting species.

We sought to determine how introduction history impacted genetic diversity and differentiation of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), one of the most broadly distributed bird species.

Significant population structure occurred between native than introduced house sparrows.

Genetic differentiation estimates identified a high magnitude of differentiation between Kenya and all other populations, but demonstrated that European and North American samples were differentiated too. Our results support previous claims that introduced North American populations likely had few source populations, and indicate house sparrows established populations after introduction. Genetic diversity also differed among native, introduced North American, and Kenyan populations with Kenyan birds being least diverse. In some cases, house sparrow populations appeared to maintain or recover genetic diversity relatively rapidly after range expansion (< 50 years; Mexico and Panama), but in others (Kenya) the effect of introduction persisted over the same period.

We aimed to examine life history variation in a highly invasive fish (Gambusia holbrooki) along latitudinal and upstream-downstream river gradients and to assess the effects of age on this variation. We hypothesized similar responses in populations inhabiting environments more favourable to this species (lower latitudes and lower reaches of rivers). Location European rivers from southern Spain to southern France. Methods We sampled mosquitofish from the lowest reaches of ten river basins along 6 degrees of latitude in the Mediterranean region and seven sites along the upstream-downstream gradient in three of the rivers. We examined abundance, population structure, size-at-age and other life history traits along these gradients. Results As hypothesized, lower reaches and lower latitudes both resulted in higher reproductive effort and lower body condition of mosquitofish. However, these patterns explained low per cent variation, were nonlinear and strongly depended on fish age. Independently of fish size, age groups differed in reproductive effort, in the gonadal weight-size relationship and its variation along spatial gradients. Mean size-at-age (or overall body size) did not vary with latitude (so the intra-specific version of Bergmann's rule or its converse does not apply) and in contrast increased upstream in rivers.

We used wild populations from five global regions (Kenya, Hawaii, Guatemala, Portugal and Greece). Adult demographic traits were monitored in the F(2), F(5), F(7) and F(9) generations in captivity. Although domestication in constant laboratory conditions had a different effect on the mortality and reproductive rates of the different populations, a general trend of decreasing life span and age of first reproduction was observed for most medfly populations tested.

Using constructed arrays of the two species, alone and in mixture, we quantified pollinator visitation at the patch and individual plant levels and measured seed production. We found that co-occurrence of our species led to a shift in pollinator services at both levels. Greater interference occurred when arrays were small and spacings between neighboring plants were large. A spatially explicit movement model suggests that pollinator foraging behavior, which mediates the interactions between plants, was driven by floral display size rather than species identity per se. Pollinator behavior significantly reduced the proportion of seed set for both species relative to that in single-species arrays.

However, modern communities are being invaded by non-indigenous species. Since natives have been associated with one another through evolutionary time, the forces promoting character and niche divergence should be high. On the other hand, exotics have evolved elsewhere, meaning that conserved traits may be more important in their new ranges. Thus, co-occurrence over sufficient time-scales for reciprocal evolution may alter how phylogenetic relationships influence assembly. Here, we examined the phylogenetic structure of native and exotic plant communities across a large-scale gradient in species richness and asked whether local assemblages are composed of more or less closely related natives and exotics and whether phylogenetic turnover among plots and among sites across this gradient is driven by turnover in close or distant relatives differentially for natives and exotics. Location Central and northern California, USA. Methods We used data from 30 to 50 replicate plots at four sites and constructed a maximum likelihood molecular phylogeny using the genes: matK, rbcl, ITS1 and 5.8s. We compared community-level measures of native and exotic phylogenetic diversity and among-plot phylobetadiversity. Results There were few exotic clades, but they tended to be widespread. Exotic species were phylogenetically clustered within communities and showed low phylogenetic turnover among communities. In contrast, the more species-rich native communities showed higher phylogenetic dispersion and turnover among sites. Main conclusions The assembly of native and exotic subcommunities appears to reflect the evolutionary histories of these species and suggests that shared traits drive exotic patterns while evolutionary differentiation drives native assembly.

Phyllobius oblongus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is common in northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region. Adults emerge in spring, feed on foliage of woody understory plants, and oviposit in the soil. Preliminary data indicate that adults often feed on sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marshall, foliage early in the season, then feed on other species such as raspberry, Rams spp. Whether this behavior reflects temporal changes in the quality of A. saccharum tissue or merely subsequent availability of later-season plants is unknown. We tested adult P. oblongus in laboratory assays using young (newly flushed) sugar maple foliage, old (2-3 wk postflush) sugar maple foliage, and raspberry foliage. Raspberry has indeterminate growth, thus always has young foliage available for herbivores. Survival, oviposition, and leaf consumption were recorded. In performance assays under no-choice conditions, mated pairs were provided one type of host foliage for the duration of their lives. In behavioral choice tests, all three host plants were provided simultaneously and leaf area consumption was compared. Adults survived longer on and consumed greater amounts of young maple and raspberry foliage than old maple foliage. P. oblongus preferred young maple foliage to old maple foliage early in the season, however, later in the growing season weevils showed less pronounced feeding preferences.

It is therefore important to investigate whether the species introduced recently by human activities have merged seamlessly into recipient ecological networks by developing interactions quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those of native species, or whether their establishment has altered the topology of the networks. We tackled this issue in the case of a well resolved interaction network between 51 forest tree taxa and 154 pathogenic fungal species. We found that alien and native species with similar phylogenetic histories and life-history strategies had similar types and numbers of interactions. Our results also suggest that the clustered architecture of the network has not been altered by the integration of alien species. It therefore seems that a few centuries have been sufficient for the network to assimilate the newly introduced species. This rapid integration was unexpected for a plant-pathogen network, because selection acts continually on plants, favouring the emergence of defences against new pathogens and impeding the development of new interactions.

The breadth was stable but included a varied proportion of different prey categories: namely an increased proportion of aquatic prey and a decreased proportion of water vole and waterfowl. The increase in abundance of American mink saw a decrease in the proportion of larger prey in their diet.

A close genetic relationship between the three invasive Heracleum species in Europe was also found. A high overall genetic variability detected in the invaded range suggests that the majority of invading populations were not affected by a genetic bottleneck and that rapid evolution, drift, or hybridization played a role in genetic structuring of invading populations. For H. mantegazzianum, genetic distance of populations in the native range significantly decreased with geographical distance, but not in the invaded range.

To evaluate these theories, we tested some biological traits of an invasive bramble (Rubus alceifolius Poiret), known for the importance of its sexual reproduction on lowlands, at La Reunion (Indian Ocean). We studied R. alceifolius seed distribution in one of the last tropical lowland rainforests of the island. Seed count was greater under R. alceifolius patches (> 10 000 seed/m(2)) than in understoreys not colonized by the bramble (approximately 3000 seed/m(2)). In R. alceifolius patches, localized within gaps, our results showed that seed-rain and seed-bank before and after the fruit period decreased significantly from the center to the edge of the gap. This pattern was certainly due to the variation in luminosity, which decreased from the center of the gap to the edge. We conclude that seed dispersal of this species within the forest is mainly via running water. A number of seeds (10%-20%) were able to wait for a new opening in which to germinate. A small proportion of these seeds remained viable in the soil for many years. Monospecific R. alceifolius patches can be considered nurseries and are the main source for colonization of new areas within the forest.

Plasticity in leaf size, inflorescence height, reproductive phenology and dispersal-related traits were measured under experimentally altered light quality (red : far-red light ratio, R : FR) and light intensity (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR). To test whether differences in means and reaction norms of dispersal-related traits between species affected colonization potential, we created seed-dispersal models based on seed-fall rate and release height. Differences in plasticity between species were not systematic, but varied in direction and magnitude among traits. Taraxacum officinale produced larger leaves that exhibited greater plasticity in size under variable light intensity than T. ceratophorum. Plasticity in scape length at flowering occurred in relation to R : FR ratio in both species, but tended to be greater in T. ceratophorum. Seed-bearing scapes of T. officinale were taller and more canalized in height across light regimes than scapes of T. ceratophorum. Seeds of T. officinale were smaller than seeds of T. ceratophorum. Models predict greater dispersal in T. officinale within open and vegetated habitats.

Although seedling emergence and establishment did not differ consistently, survival thereafter was twice as high for eight introduced North American than eight native European Populations. As predicted, introduced plants were more likely to produce sexual inflorescences and clonal asexual vegetative bulbils, and they invested much more biomass in both reproductive modes. Higher reproductive investment was due to higher proportional allocation of biomass rather than larger plant size. These results are consistent with selection for increased reproduction during range expansion. However, population genetic surveys indicate that recruitment from seed rarely occurs in introduced populations. Hence increased sexual allocation is not an adaptive response to invasion. Although increased clonal reproduction may be advantageous in expanding populations, genetic evidence from introduced populations of B. umbellatus suggests that increased clonal allocation may have arisen via stochastic processes during long-distance transport or a selective filter right at introduction, rather than incremental natural selection during range expansion.",Web of Science,Butomus umbellatus,Canada,Ontario,,,,Greenhouse,lentic,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Clonal Reproduction,primary

Slug diversity and abundance appear to be low in North America compared with Europe, and we therefore hypothesized that release from slug herbivory contributes to the invasiveness of European Brassicaceae species in North America. 2 In common garden and glasshouse experiments we compared life history and fitness parameters in native (NP) and introduced (IP) provenances of four invasive Brassicaceae species (Barbarea vulgaris, Bunias orientalis, Cardaria draba, Rorippa austriaca) that were subjected to herbivory by Arion lusitanicus. In climate chamber bioassays we investigated slug damage to seedlings and leaf discs using the same sources of plant material. 3 In all species except B. orientalis we found significant but not always consistent differences in growth and reproductive characteristics between IP and NP plants. Plants of B. vulgaris and R. austriaca from the introduced range had a considerably higher growth rate than those from the native range. While IP plants of the non-clonal B. vulgaris allocated more resources to seed production than NP plants, the IP plants of the clonal R. austriaca showed a decreased number of seeds. 4 Contrary to expectation, there were no differences between NP plants and IP plants in the number of damaged leaves and leaf area consumed by slugs, or in the proportion of seedlings damaged and killed. Nor were there interaction effects between slug treatments and provenance. 5 The results suggest that there are genetically based differences in growth and reproductive parameters between NP and IP plants. As there were no differences in herbivore damage between the provenances, this genetic differentiation is probably due to factors such as competition rather than herbivore effects. 6 In order to make progress in understanding why some species become invasive, more comparative experimental studies are needed that investigate how different kinds of antagonists (generalist and specialist herbivores and pathogens) influence the performance of plants at different life stages.",Web of Science,Barbarea vulgaris;Bunias orientalis;Cardaria draba;Rorippa austriaca,USA,,Great Lakes,,,Greenhouse;Garden,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

This shade-tolerant grass weed of Asian origin forms dense populations in the understory of moist deciduous forests in eastern North America. In autumn each flowering tiller produces one terminal raceme with CH spikelets and 2 to 7 sheath-enclosed axillary racemes with CL spikelets at the uppermost nodes. In a greenhouse, plants were reared from seed families collected from individuals in subpopulations of shady (2 to 8 % full sun) or sunny, edge habitats. At maturity, tillers of the shade subpopulation showed greater allocation to leaves, but reduced allocation to CH and CL, compared to those from the sunny subpopulation, suggesting adaptive differentiation to light conditions in the field. Maternal family (within subpopulation) had a significant effect on CH allocation and the mean mass of CH and CL seeds. For mature tillers collected directly from the field habitats, allocation to CH and CL was lowest, and allocation to leaves was greatest, in deep shade. CH and CL allocation averaged 16 % and 11 %, respectively, in the sunny habitat, but only 6 % and 7 % in the shady habitat. There was no evidence of a trade-off in allocation to CH vs. CL in field-collected or greenhouse tillers; in fact, there was a significant positive correlation of CH with CL allocation.

In deciduous forests, the presence of overstory trees and shrubs creates a shifting mosaic of resources for understory plants, with implications for their distribution and abundance. Determination of the ultimate resource constraints on understory vegetation may aid management of these systems that have become increasingly susceptible to invasions by non-native plants. Microstegium vimineum (Japanese grass) is an invasive annual grass that has spread rapidly throughout the understory of forests across the eastern United States since it was first observed in Tennessee in 1919. M. vimineum occurs as extensive, dense patches in the understory of eastern deciduous forests, yet these patches often exhibit sharp boundaries and distinct gaps in cover. One example of this distributional pattern was observed relative to the native midstory tree Asimina triloba (pawpaw), whereby dense M. vimineum cover stopped abruptly at the drip line of the A. triloba patch and was absent beneath the A. triloba canopy. We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to test several hypotheses regarding the causes of this observed pattern of M. vimineum distribution, including allelopathy, seed dispersal, light limitations, and soil moisture, texture, and nutrient content. We concluded that light reduction by the A. triloba canopy was the environmental constraint that prevented establishment of M. vimineum beneath this tree. Whereas overstory tree canopy apparently facilitates the establishment of this shade-tolerant grass, the interaction of overstory canopy with midstory canopy interferes with M. vimineum by reducing the availability of sunflecks at the ground layer. It is likely that other midstory species influence the distribution and abundance of other herb-layer species, with implications for management of understory invasive plant species.",Web of Science,Microstegium vimineum,USA,,,,,Field - Experimental;Greenhouse,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest,Fundamentals,,,primary

As abundances of C. gigas rose, some mussel beds became increasingly overgrown with oysters, whereas others did not. Field experiments revealed that recruitment of C. gigas was higher in the lower intertidal than in the upper subtidal zone, that it was higher on conspecifics than on mussels, and that it was not affected by barnacle epigrowth except when settling on mussels. Mussel recruitment is known from inter- and subtidal zones. It occurred equally on oyster and mussel shells but showed a clear preference for barnacle epigrowth over clean shells. Assuming that settlement and recruitment are key processes for species abundances on the North Sea coast, it is predicted that the positive feedback in oyster settlement will lead to rapid reef formation of this invader at the expense of mussel beds. Mussels, however, may escape competitive exclusion by settling between or on the larger oysters especially when barnacles are abundant. Experimental patches with mussels were more often covered by fucoid algae (Fucus vesiculosus forma mytili Nienburg) than patches with oysters, and oyster recruitment was poor underneath such algal canopies. Thus, fucoids may provide the native mussels with a refuge from the invading oysters and the two bivalves may coexist, provided food is not limiting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Given the little time between hybrid creation and sampling, and the moderate standing genetic variance for life-history traits in hybrids, we show that some of the observed trait changes between parents and hybrids were unlikely to arise only by continuous selection.

To help address these questions, we compared demographics for an invasive plant species, Rubus discolor, with a noninvasive congener, R. ursinus, in several populations of varying density. Removal of floral buds from reproductive canes increased the size of juvenile canes that arose from clonal sprouting in R. ursinus, suggesting a trade-off between current reproduction and growth. Removal of floral buds had no effect on growth of R. discolor. R. ursinus displayed trade-offs between reproduction (sexual and vegetative) and future growth based on negative correlations between leaf area production and both clonal sprouting and seedling production during the previous year. R. discolor did not exhibit these trade-offs. Both species had high population growth rates in low-density populations, but exhibited little or no growth in high-density populations. A life table response experiment was used to determine the underlying cause for the effect of density on population growth. For R. ursinus, lack of population growth in high-density populations was due primarily to increased mortality of clonally sprouting canes, while for R. discolor, it was due to decreased clonal cane production. Elasticity analysis revealed that clonal growth was more important than sexual reproduction for population growth of both species. However, elasticity values for sexual reproduction in R. discolor were greater in high- than low-density populations. This suggests an increased reliance on sexual reproduction in populations that had reached stable sizes, which could increase the capacity of R. discolor to disperse to new sites.

The movement of species from their native ranges to alien environments is a serious threat to biological diversity. The number of individuals involved in an invasion provides a strong theoretical basis for determining the likelihood of establishment of an alien species. 2. Here a field experiment was used to manipulate the critical first stages of the invasion of an alien insect, a psyllid weed biocontrol agent, Arytainilla spartiophila Forster, in New Zealand and to observe the progress of the invasion over the following 6 years. 3. Fifty-five releases were made along a linear transect 135 km long: 10 releases of two, four, 10, 30 and 90 psyllids and five releases of 270 psyllids. Six years after their original release, psyllids were present in 22 of the 55 release sites. Analysis by logistic regression showed that the probability of establishment was significantly and positively related to initial release size, but that this effect was important only during the psyllids' first year in the field. 4. Although less likely to establish, some of the releases of two and four psyllids did survive 5 years in the field. Overall, releases that survived their first year had a 96% chance of surviving thereafter, providing the release site remained secure. The probability of colony loss due to site destruction remained the same throughout the experiment, whereas the probability of natural extinction reduced steeply over time. 5. During the first year colonies were undergoing a process of establishment and, in most cases, population size decreased. After this first year, a period of exponential growth ensued. 6. A lag period was observed before the populations increased dramatically in size. This was thought to be due to inherent lags caused by the nature of population growth, which causes the smaller releases to appear to have a longer lag period.",Web of Science,Arytainilla spartiophila,New Zealand,,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,herbivore

This creates the opportunity to study reactions to founder effect and how a species can circumvent deleterious effects of bottlenecks such as reduced genetic diversity. inbreeding and extinction through mutational meltdown. to emerge as a highly invasive plant. Methods A population genetic survey by random amplified polymorphism DNA markers (RAPD) together with historical insights and a field pollination experiment were carried out. Key Results At the regional scale. S. purpurea shows low structure (theta(st) = 0.072) due to a recent founder event and important subsequent growth. Nevertheless. multivariate statistical analyses reveal that. because of a bottleneck that shifted allele frequencies, most of the variability is independent among populations. In one population (Tenasses) the species has become invasive and genetic analysis reveals restricted gene flow and family, structure (theta(st) = 0.287). Although inbreeding appears to be high (F-is > 0.410 from a Bavesian estimation). a field pollination experiment failed to detect significant inbreeding depression upon F-1 seed number and seed weight fitness-trots. Furthermore. crosses between unrelated individuals produced F-1 seeds with significantly reduced fitness. thus showing local outbreeding depression. Conclusions The results suggest that. under restricted gene flow among families. the species may not only have rapidly purged deleterious alleles. but also have undergone some form of selection for inbreeding due to co-adaptation between loci.

In particular, we explored the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity in response to biotic and abiotic factors explains the observed differences in competitiveness between invasive and native species. The seedlings' ability to exploit different resource availabilities was examined in a two factorial experimental design of light and nutrient treatments by analysing 20 physiological and morphological traits. Competitiveness was tested using an additive experimental design in combination with N-15-labelling experiments. Light and nutrient availability had only minor effects on most physiological traits and differences between species were not significant. Plasticity in response to changes in resource availability occurred in morphological and allocation traits, revealing A. longifolia to be a species of intermediate responsiveness. The major competitive advantage of A. longifolia was its constitutively high shoot elongation rate at most resource treatments and its effective nutrient acquisition. Further, A. longifolia was found to be highly tolerant against competition from native species. In contrast to common expectations, the competition experiment indicated that A. longifolia expressed a constant allocation pattern and a phenotypic plasticity similar to that of the native species.",Web of Science,Acacia longifolia,,,Mediterranean,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,Chaparral/Shrublands,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority;Plasticity,Superior Competitor;Rapid Growth,primary

This paper explores the main climatic, territorial, and anthropic correlates of alien plant species richness and percentage in Catalonia (NE of Spain), by means of GIS techniques. We used floristic data collected in FLORACAT per UTM 10 km x 10 km to set up the number and the percentage of alien species. The association of these variables with climate, topography, landscape, human settlement, and geographic position was explored by means of stepwise regression models applied on the axes obtained from principal component analysis. The significance of the resulting correlates was tested using the modified t test of Dutilleul to remove the effects of spatial autocorrelation. PCA reduced the 22 variables to 12 principal components (PC) that explained 90% of the cumulative variance. Regression models were highly significant and captured a high proportion of total variance (adjusted r(2) = 0.70 for alien species richness and r(2) = 0.56 for alien species percentage). Both alien species richness and percentage were mainly correlated to PC summarising variables concerning climate, habitat and landscape heterogeneity, and potential anthropogenic disturbance. However, while these PC exhibited similar weights on alien species richness, species percentage was mainly determined by climate. Implications for conservation are discussed considering a future scenario of climate warming and increasing land use change in Mediterranean areas.

Pennisetum setaceum is apomictic, a condition that is normally associated with low genetic variation within populations, but even moderate levels of genetic variation among populations could account for differences in invasiveness. To determine whether genetic factors are causing the variable invasion success, we used Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat markers (ISSRs) to examine genetic variation in populations from the three areas. Screening of 16 primers revealed no genetic variation within any population or between any geographical areas, a pattern consistent with complete apomixis. Variation in invasion success appears unrelated to genetic differences among populations. Differences in the seasonal timing of rainfall among the regions may be the cause of variable invasiveness of fountain grass. Alternatively, differences in timing of introduction or duration of lag phase may have limited invasiveness in Arizona and southern California.",Web of Science,Pennisetum setaceum,United States,Arizona; California; Hawaii,,,,Field - Observational;Lab,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

For example, growth regulator herbicides and biological control agents can dramatically reduce leafy spurge production while having little or no influence oil grass production, and overgrazing can reduce grass production while not substantially influencing leafy spurge production because cattle typically ingest little or no leafy spurge. To predict how grass production will respond to a perturbation that influences only leafy spurge and to predict how leafy spurge production will respond to a perturbation that affects only grasses, competitive relationships must be understood. Seeding mixtures of leafy spurge and 2 grasses were planted in experiments and grown for 127 days to determine whether different water application regimes influenced competition among these 3 species. Competition became less intense as the number of water applications increased. If this finding holds true under field conditions, then it indicates that competition is less intense in years and locations with numerous precipitation events. Competitive interactions (i.e., competition coefficients) were less variable when water was applied more frequently, hot the ability of models to account for variation in plant weight (i.e., r(2)) was not influenced by the frequency of water application. This suggests that models will predict invasive plant and grass biomass with equal accuracy in years with few or many precipitation events. Competitive effects were similar regardless of grass species, which suggests that grasses might be considered collectively in predicting response to perturbations in the field.",Web of Science,Euphorbia esula,United States,,,,,Greenhouse,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Inherent Superiority,Superior Competitor,primary

Absence of herbivores may result in selection for the loss of costly herbivore-resistance traits, which are expected to show a trade-off with vigour or competitive ability (the evolution of increased competitive ability, or EICA, hypothesis). 2 We conducted a common garden experiment in Switzerland, in which we compared herbivore resistance and vigour of Senecio jacobaea plants exposed to the specialist flea beetle Longitarsus jacobaeae, for four populations originating within the native range (Europe), and four from regions where it had been introduced (New Zealand, USA) and was unaffected by L. jacobaeae. Our predictions were that, compared with plants from the native populations, plants from introduced populations would experience greater herbivory (due to loss of resistance traits), and exhibit more vigorous growth. 3 As expected, we found that introduced S. jacobaea grew larger, and had greater reproductive output, than plants from the native range. Larger plants experienced more feeding damage, and introduced plants were consumed more even when size differences were controlled. Introduced plants also exhibited a greater relative ability to reproduce after damage was sustained, i.e. higher tolerance to herbivory. 4 Contrary to predictions, however, plants from introduced populations had higher total pyrrolizidine alkaloid production (chemical defence against herbivores). 5 Although plants from introduced ranges exhibited life-history traits consistent with EICA predictions, similar phenotypes were common in one of the populations from the native range, suggesting that EICA may not fully explain the invasion success of S. jacobaea. 6 Our results imply that increased competitive ability (vigour) of invasive plants may be associated with changes in resistance as well as tolerance to herbivory, and both types of anti-herbivore defence may need to be examined simultaneously to advance our understanding of invasiveness.",Web of Science,Senecio jacobaea,Switzerland,,,,,Garden,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability,,primary

Dispersal plays a role in the colonization of exotic invasive species into new areas and this study was conducted to determine if the invasiveness of Dioscorea oppositifolia L. (Chinese yam) is facilitated by secondary dispersal of vegetative diaspores (bulbils) by water. Since seed production of this plant has not been observed in the United States, bulbils represent the only means of dispersal to new habitats. Dispersal was monitored by placing aquatic traps, tethered bulbils, and painted bulbil caches in a tributary of Drury Creek, Giant City State Park, Illinois. Results indicate that high-energy flow in the creek accelerated secondary dispersal of bulbils downstream and onto the floodplain. The longest recorded dispersal distance was 206.2 in downstream. Dispersal distance of tethered bulbils was not related to rainfall or flow velocity in the creek; however the total number of bulbils trapped was positively related to flow velocity. We conclude that secondary dispersal by water in streams can facilitate dispersal of vegetative bulbils of this exotic species.",Web of Science,Dioscorea oppositifolia,United States,Illinois,,,,Field - Observational,lotic,Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Other,,primary

However, there has been relatively little work, either empirical or theoretical, that has tested this assertion. Here, we develop a patch occupancy model for diploid organisms that reproduce sexually, and use it to investigate the dynamics of an introduced species. The model produces some interesting insights: If the introduced individuals are already well-adapted to the wild conditions, then the number of escapees is always larger when there are more introductions. However, when the introduced individuals are relatively poorly adapted to the natural conditions, this is often not the case. Under these conditions, the most rapid invasion occurs for an intermediate number of introductions. When the number of introductions is high, adaptation to local conditions is dramatically slowed and in some cases a well-adapted population never establishes. Thus, high propagule pressure does not necessarily lead to greater invasability. We believe that the model framework described in this paper can be a powerful tool for biologists interested in the genetics and evolution of invasive species, and spatially structured populations in general.",Web of Science,,,,,,,Theoretical/Modeling,terrestrial,,Invasion Hyp.,Propagule Pressure,,

Species native to the southeastern Pyrenees watershed were also significantly different from species native to the rest of the Iberian Peninsula but not native to this watershed. Iberian exotic species come predominantly from large river basins, whereas Catalan streams (and other small, coastal river basins) correspond to basins and streams of a smaller size and different hydrology, with differences in species composition and life-history traits of fish.

Fresh seed showed high viability (99.5%) and germinated readily, with 97.2% of all recorded germinations occurring within 14 days. Mean germination rates ranged from 74 to 100% across the range of temperature (10/20 degrees C, 15/25 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C alternating 12-h thermoperiods) and light (0- and 12-h photoperiods) treatments. Germination was significantly reduced only under cool, dark conditions. In a 24-month field experiment, seedling emergence was greatest for seeds buried at 1 cm (mean = 96.3%), intermediate for seeds buried at 5 cm (mean = 62.7%) and least for surface-sown seeds (mean = 30.7%). Seed persistence under field conditions was low, declining rapidly to 3.9% at 6 months and to 0.67% at 24 months. Moth vine's capacity to germinate readily and the rapid depletion of seeds under field conditions indicate that the species has a transient seed bank in south-eastern Queensland. In an additional experiment testing the capacity of seeds for secondary dispersal by water, the mean floating time of seeds was 15.4 days, suggesting that water could act as a secondary dispersal vector, contributing to long-distance dispersal.

I investigated the roles of experimental manipulation of understorey species richness and overstorey characteristics in resistance to invader establishment in a floodplain forest in south-western Virginia, USA. 2 I manipulated resident species richness in experimental plots along a flooding gradient, keeping plot densities at their original levels, and quantified the overstorey characteristics of each plot. 3 After manipulating the communities, I transplanted 10 randomly chosen invaders from widespread native and non-native forest species into the experimental plots. Success of an invasion was measured by survival and growth of the invader. 4 Native and non-native invader establishment trends were influenced by different aspects of the biotic community and these relationships depended on the site of invasion. The most significant influence on non-native invader survival in this system of streamside and upper terrace plots was the overstorey composition. Non-native species survival in the flooded plots after 2 years was significantly positively related to proximity to larger trees. However, light levels did not fully explain the overstorey effect and were unrelated to native survivorship. The effects of understorey richness on survivorship depended on the origin of the invaders and the sites they were transplanted into. Additionally, native species growth was significantly affected by understorey plot richness. 5 The direction and strength of interactions with both the overstorey (for non-native invaders) and understorey richness (for natives and non-natives) changed with the site of invasion and associated environmental conditions. Rather than supporting the hypothesis of biotic resistance to non-native invasion, my results suggest that native invaders experienced increased competition with the native understorey plants in the more benign upland habitat and facilitation in the stressful riparian zone.",Web of Science,Many,United States,Virginia,,,,,terrestrial,Deciduous Forest;Riparian,Invasion Hyp.,Community Species Richness,,primary

Evidence from field experiments in New Zealand short tussock grassland,journal,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,7,2,195,211,"The theory of fluctuating resource availability proposes that the susceptibility of a plant community to invasion by new species (i.e., invasibility) depends upon conditions of intermittent resource enrichment coinciding with the presence of invading propagules. We compared the response of a rapidly invading forb (Hieracium pilosella L.) between different experimental treatments in a short tussock grassland in New Zealand, over 6-12 years, to determine whether the theory explains differences in invasibility. The theory predicts that environments subject to periodic resource enrichment will be more invasible than those with more stable resource-supply rates. In our study, H. pilosella did not increase more rapidly in treatments subject to periodic resource pulses (fertiliser and water) than in those with more stable resource supplies. Also contrary to the predictions of the theory, the rate of invasion of H. pilosella did not increase following an increase in the rate of supply of water or nutrient resources, or following treatments that temporarily reduced resource uptake in the community, including grazing. H. pilosella did not increase immediately following abrupt increases in water and nutrient supply and removal of the dominant grass species with herbicide, as predicted by the theory, although temporary increases in resident exotic guilds indicated that the intensity of competition for resources was reduced. Neither H. pilosella nor resident exotic guilds showed increased cover growth rates following resumed grazing. The rate of invasion by H. pilosella was not correlated with species richness, a result consistent with one of the predictions of the theory. Therefore, short-lived events that temporarily reduced or suspended competition did not appear to determine the invasion success of this particular species in this region. In New Zealands perennial short tussock grasslands, the characteristics of the resident plant community may be more critical than resource fluctuations in determining invasion success of H. pilosella. Invasion of H. pilosella may be most successfully controlled here by promoting a successional physiognomic shift to a taller, shrub-and-tussock-dominated canopy that competitively excludes low-growing forbs.",Web of Science,Hieracium pilosella,New Zealand,,,,,Field - Experimental,terrestrial,Grassland,Invasion Hyp.,Fluctuating Resources,,primary
