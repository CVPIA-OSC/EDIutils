The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) funds habitat
improvement work in the Central Valley of California to increase
salmonid populations in furtherance of meeting CVPIA fish doubling
goals. This dataset covers salmonid observations conducted in the
Sacramento River and focused on assessing effectiveness of salmonid
habitat improvement projects. Surveys are conducted roughly every other
week and include pre-project sites, constructed habitat project sites,
and control sites where no treatment is planned. Sites are snorkeled by
a crew of two to three people and all salmonids are counted by size
category within pre-set survey reaches. Snorkelers record data on dive
slates and then transcribe to paper data sheets and computer files.
Annual reports summarize the survey findings.

Data collection methods have been selected that have the least possible
impact on at-risk salmonid stocks and can still meet hypothesis testing
objectives. As a result, data may be less quantitative than would be
possible if a wider range of field methods were employed, and may
include more assumptions when validating the linkage between restoration
actions and the biologic response.
