The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) funds habitat improvement work in the Central Valley of California to increase salmonid populations in furtherance of meeting CVPIA fish doubling goals.  This dataset covers salmonid observations conducted in the Sacramento River and focused on assessing effectiveness of salmonid habitat improvement projects.  Surveys are conducted roughly every other week and include pre-project sites, constructed habitat project sites, and control sites where no treatment is planned.  Sites are snorkeled by a crew of two to three people and all salmonids are counted by size category within pre-set survey reaches.  Snorkelers record data on dive slates and then transcribe to paper data sheets and computer files.  Annual reports summarize the survey findings.
